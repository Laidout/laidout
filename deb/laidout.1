Laidout \- Version 0.097.1, for laying out books, and playing with odd interfaces.

.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLaidout\fP can be used to lay out pictures and more into cut and folded
books. For instance, from 11x17 inch master sheets, one can cut and fold in
such a way that produces 3 cute little 5.5x5.6 inch booklets.

Donations are encouraged! Money, code, and testing, that is, not bugs.

.SH OPTIONS
Options can be given as long (two dashes) or short (one dash).
A summary of options is included below.


.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show this summary and exit.

.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print out version info, then exit.

.TP
.B \-X, \-\-export\-formats
List all the available export formats

.TP
.B \-O, \-\-list\-export\-options format
List all the options for the given format

.TP
.B \-e, \-\-export 'format=EPS start=3'
Export a document based on the given options

.TP
.B \-N, \-\-no\-template
Do not use a default template

.TP
.B \-n, \-\-new \fISPECIFICATION\fI
Create a new document, bypassing the new document dialog. You can specify
a comma separated list of attributes describing the paper size, orientation,
imposition, and number of pages. So for instance a 40 page booklet on folded 
legal sized paper oriented as landscape would be specified with:

.B laidout \-n 'legal,landscape,booklet,40'

You can also start with a new document based on unfolding a box with dimensions
of, say, 1, 2, and 3 inches like this:

.B laidout \-n 'box 1 2 3'

.TP
.B \-t, \-\-template \fItemplate_name\fI
Open laidout from this template. If the name does not start with "../", "./",
or "/", then it looks in your $HOME/.laidout/(version)/templates directory.
These templates can be any valid Laidout document file. The file is loaded,
and its file location cleared so that you will be forced to enter a new
location for it when you try to save it.

If you have default_template set to something in your laidoutrc file, such as with
a line like "default_template default" then when you start Laidout with
no arguments, that template will be loaded (in this case templates/default
will be loaded), rather then prompting you through the new document dialog.

.TP
.B \-F, \-\-file\-format
Print out a pseudocode mockup of the file format, then exit

.TP
.B \-c, \-\-command 'newdoc net'
