/*! \defgroup extras Extras
 * Extraneous addon type of things are documented here. These are functions and such
 * that are not considered core functionality, but are still hella useful.
 *
 * Currently:
 * 
 * dumpInImages() plops down a whole lot of images into the document. Specify the start page,
 * how many per page, and either a list of image files, a directory that contains the images,
 * or a list of ImageData objects.
 *
 * \todo *** must figure out how to integrate extras into menus, and incorporate callbacks?
 *   Have a class Extra that holds everything about it?
 * \todo Still must work out good mechanism for being able to add on any extras via plugins...
