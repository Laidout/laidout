TODO: grab pot from Laxkit!!



-------------------------- Updating Basic Info -----------------------
1. POTFILES is a list of files to grab translatable strings from.
   To regenerate that file, do:
    make potfiles

2. laidout.pot is base template file. Refresh with:
    make update
   This will make a file laidout-freshdump.pot, and merge it with any existing laidout.pot.
   laidout-freshdump.pot may be removed at this point. laidout.pot is the file you want.



-------------------------- Making New Translations -------------------
1. Update the basic info as above.

2. The Laxkit also has numerous translatable strings. These can be found
   in its laxkit.pot file. Those strings may have been translated to the desired
   language already. If so, then do this:
    msgmerge laidout.pot laxkit.pot > laidout-and-laxkit.pot

   Now make the necessary changes to that pot file, and save to the correct language
   name in this directory. For instance, canadian english would be en_CA.po. 



----------------------- Installation of the translation files ---------------
1. Plain "make" will compile all the .po files found there.

2. TODO: installation of po files



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------For reference, here's the basics of translation file management: -------------
1. xgettext -C -d laidout  --files-from POTFILES -o laidout.pot --keyword=_ --flag=_:1:pass-c-format

 ----> makes a pot file, usually from a file called po/POTFILES, with translatable strings listed
 then, edit that file to have a proper header, and make it a master po file.
 translators make their own en_CA.po, es.po, etc based on the master pot file

2. msgmerge old.pot new.pot > newest.pot  will merge new strings with an existing pot file

3. msgfmt converts the .po files into .mo (or .gmo) files

4. these are installed typically in /usr/share/locale/en_CA/LC_MESSAGES/thedomainname.mo,
                              or $(prefix)/share/locale/...

		foreach *.mo    install $(prefix)/share/locale/`basename $NAME .po`/LC_MESSAGES/laidout.mo
