\section basics Next on the list..

\section Overall Overall...
<pre>
 enhance SpreadEditor
 implement object nesting: 1 parent, many children, this is different
   than having a Group
 text tool, text blocks (big job !!!)
 reasonable image loading and using
 cairo? antigrain? opengl?  hot-swappable rendering backend?
 freehand tool
 tablet support
 low level object tree editor would be very convenient, like
   the xml editor of inkscape.. to do similar right now, have to save,
   then edit the file, then load
 pdf out
 
 


Next: MUst have color management..., have to imp the color system....

Define protocols for inter-window communication, and scripting integration...

a help window?

impositions should have final printing shift matrix? to temporarily remap any imposition
to any paper size, possibly with stuff off paper.. 
the WhackedImposition: have a single page data map to many papers (using different transforms),
sometimes known as posterizing..

splitwindow, main control panel... there are a few basic windows right now, but 
they must fit into a whole window framework which still needs to be implemented with
Laxkit::SplitWindow and Laxkit::TabbedMenuSelector or whatever it'll be called!!!

work on page and spread flipper:   < page 2 >,       < > page ixv,    
tool flipper:  [< Path Tool >]

*** figure out consistent way to have Attribute things attached to various kinds of objects.

Color picker should be like scribus's which has previews of 
	black/white text of various shades of the picked color

viewport options:
	one tool per viewport --OR-- optionally keep same tool across viewports.

(ruler==obj || paper/page) [ ruler -> ]
		[ruler|]
		[     v]

interfaces: have it configurable: mapping buttons?? or just sock it to em?

Dynamic content object, for instance a box that lets you swirl 3-dimensional things
around until you get a view that you like, and that view is what prints. (openoffice has
something of the kind)


pages need to be able to preempt the page boundaries given by disposition,
OR the disposition needs to act on a selection of pages, not all of them..
This would make cover/book body more reasonable.
what about centerfolds?? have those
pages map to same page? fill out whole spreads like that? auto adjust margins...
CompositeDisposition
	range 1-20 Booklet disp
	range 21-25 Cover disp



have option to save preview images for images over a certain size. 
This saves mondo time when restarting when
working on documents with lots of huge images: preview images don't have to be
generated each time, just load the already figured ones, but check for image being
newer than the preview!!
like huge.tiff -> .huge.preview.png
