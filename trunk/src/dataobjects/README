This directory contains definitions for various drawable objects in Laidout.
New objects must derive from DrawableObject. If you want the objects to be
scriptable, then you must implement some functions from Value.
See limagedata.cc for an example.

Once implemented, you must add a creator function in datafactory.cc to actually be
able to use these new objects.

If you also have an interface to go along with your new objects, you also must
add creation code for the interface in ../interfaces.cc. If you do not have
a specific interface, the object tool will be used instead.

If you make an interface that does not work on specific objects, then those
interfaces should go in ../interfaces.
