This file is for random notes and specific coding tasks that need to be done
to meet various goals. This includes Roadmap items as well as fixing bugs.
List bug tracker number if any.

When an item is satisfied, put it in the DONE section at bottom of file.
Those are purged with each release.



--------------bugs: things that do not work like they are already allegedly designed to---------------------


---- serious bugs to fix right now:

lack of custom page size input

scribus plugin: if directory of executable script is not writable, it fails! 
 -> should find one that is writable

ContextMenu: tablet mouse can't click down in?!??
ContextMenu: mouse hover scan appears to ignore text pad

DONE impose only MUST NOT IGNORE the current document page count
DONE scribus export ignoring landscape flag?!
scribus import: need to read page sizes from actual page attributes, as it may well be different than in document attributes
papergroup tool NEEDS 1:1 paper matrix reset, maybe say what paper dimensions
papergroup tool needs custom paper input
scribus export should show actual version export

hang after reparent

text window controls have difficulties

shearing produced null axes

tooltips and event timers seem to be frelled

object reordering frelled, strange bbox display offset, 

key window not showing fields!!!

clone a child.. NOT PUTTING CORRECTLY!!!! totally wrong matrix
cloning, change original, not triggering bbox update in clone
cloning, jump to object in offscreen page, switches pages, but bounding box wrong place

don't allow reparent to a child!! or reparent as appropriate

prompt window is f'd up

grouping frelled.. can group, but cannot seem to select existing groups to ungroup

Printing only goes to letter, even though page size says go full page, in image, pdf and ps out!!! *(#@*&#*(&*&$(
print command to printer is not respecting the paper size

file format dump is not showing dump of object types

laidout import, does not appear to scale correctly, does odd scaling, and inserts unneccesary layers
  maybe option to create new layers, or insert to existing layers?
  option to insert new pages, or merge onto existing pages
  need to center within new margin area, as compared to previous margin area

drawing partial arcs broken

test-tiled-mark.laidout: delete the bars, add bars back then try to export, program stops (not a segfault)!!!! headwindow gets decremented somehow

select none, select doc, viewport jumps around... it should stay the same area
switch to None document, and units change to unreasonable


---- bugs:

debian/rules seems to need dh_shlibdeps --dpkg-shlibdeps-params=--ignore-missing-info, due to some kind of libGL mixup

why no icon in menus?

svg out, EquivalentObject doesn't play nice with defs.. only accessed once.. how to upkeep clones in this case?

SimpleColorAttribute() should have double rgba available

make singles 16 pages, edit imposition, select booklet. Defaults to 4 pages!

page range, control click on page 1 less than a range won't let you click for new range

impositioneditor not remembering window position

sigimp fail for multiple stacks with no folds!!

Spread Editor memory hole

viewwindow, change to spreadview, change back to view.. Horizontal ruler origin is REALLY off


memory hole when graphical shell activated

datarefs on images scale not like images

html dump must convert chars to entities

need to implement scale pages to new imposition when reimposing (enable in doc settings dialog)

svg coord numpoints==0???? numpoints doesn't really serve any purpose other than debugging, but....

spiltwindow cursors existing in subwindows

copy paste not working again

object tool shift-control for rotate does not allow positioning on drag bars

'g' for color sample changes cursor to cancel now, and changes on border cross!!!

possible modifier-pairing error with multiple mice...

do laidout -n letter, split a window, then quit. undeleted Objects remain!

recent files do not appear to be most recent file opened

object deleting funky, import svg images, select one, hit delete, doesn't delete!!
place 3 images, object select, must press delete twice...!?!?!?!

should not be able to group select an object and another object nested within

transparency in paths does not work on screen

file previewer not updating preview when using arrow keys

create new window, defaults to no doc. should select doc of last pane

add blank image, change description, do not change filename, makes width/height zap back to 0...

shrink image lets you go immeasurably small

fold indicator foldprogress just at crossover points incorrectly indicating affected folds

pixels units should be set as per document dpi

svg to coord incomplete
memory hole in svg in? test svg import, svg path import must be done

make sure all imposition types are available in interpreter

resource impositions not showing description when selected

GradientInterface problem rendering radial when two circles separated by large distance

Laxkit::MultiLineEdit needs some serious debugging

headwindow swapping is now REALLY messed up
pane swapping/dropto on maximized, swapping in general...

WATCH OUT for when preview file is OLDER than original file!!

pdf export if a path has null linestyle/fillstyle it buffers until next path drawn
   instead of drawing with some default style

  click on base cell, update viewport color box
  save color hints of base cells with Tiling object
  change color of boundary, and outline preview

  scale free
  stretch, proxy displays ok, but after install stretch doesn't work
  shear *** seems to be off from point, need shear protection, produces null axes sometimes
  DONE scale
  DONE rotate
  DONE scale+rotate
  DONE move

  add page target anchor
  add parent target anchor
  add object anchor
  margin area not working
  implement rules list click remove

  anchor names should not have quotes in them, because disk i/o is easier and I'm lazy
  problems when anchors are on a page that is not at origin?
  check for only align objects that are on pages
  margin area anchors not staying when margins change
  transform relative to alignment point of parent (50,50) for center, for instance
  code
  edge magnet
  when trying to move an anchor when you still need to select invariants, flash the invariants
  need edge indicators for more convenient snapping


gshell: test

calculator
  showing defined functions should show the code
  set dump_out_atts should do full atts if any subattribute has full atts, else output "set": "{1,2,3}"
  dump_out_atts should output raw toStr things.. Strings currently return "str" which is output "\"str\""
  debug for
  debug generic with operators, doesn't seem to be working
  debug operator definitions
  debug using and import... maybe remove using, use import Math.* instead
  debug number deref: var a={1,2}.. out of bounds not returning cannot deref.. returning "Ok"
  var a if a already exists should fail
  error reporting up function calls doesn't say pos/line for each expression
  overloading does not handle parameter mapping per overloaded, it is scanning only the first, and using that
  print string plus any non string should stringify the thing and append to string
  curline not getting incremented properly when there is skipping or looping going on
  implement a PaperSizes object that recognizes all the names, or maybe a set somewhere with all names?
  Math.oeuaeou does not produce an error
  allow if statements on single line without curly braces
  inputting lines when open {"( maybe prompt "... " to wait for closure?
  how best to allow created object defs to be referenced as parameter, variable, or set types, it is a mess right now
  destructors
  show overloaded entries

  DONE debug "return value"
  DONE debug foreach
  DONE debug "break;"
  DONE debug class definitions
  DONE implement GenericValue, to allow fully scripted values
  DONE need "print" function
  DONE show (variable) should show the objectdef for that variable
  DONE debug if,while
  DONE debug if {a=2, b=3} or {a:2, b:3} or {a:2; b:3}, then scan in hash instead of set
  DONE 1/0 crashes
  DONE assignment still off, need to be able to do a.x=3;
  DONE debug function definitions
  DONE skipBlock does not obey // and /**/ commenting
  DONE a=(1,2); a.x crashes
  DONE show Laidout.Affine should show all fields
  DONE debug name lookup, assignment, etc
  DONE debug things like "show Math.sin"  --> is looking in scope namespace, rather than entries
  DONE allow // or /*comments*/ ?
  DONE AddName seems to work unevenly
  DONE change toCChar() and CChar() to int makeStr(char *&buffer,int &len, int oktoreallocate);


overlays should get first pick of input, BUT if another has a button lock, it shouldn't mouse move update

gshell:
    *** not getting options for all tool and object!!
    searching seems to be messed up, improper matches when mid stream
	mid stream search is messing up match names
    completion should be worked into the edit.. "object.|" then tab is replacing all text with field name
    when in function, search among parameter names also
    need to search for context names before searching for calculator names
    search within area, not total tree
    text delete to nothing should only show the top areas in search results
    thoroughly test object access
    object.translate((1,0)) -> MapParameters should map the flatvector to p, not to x
    shift up/down for showing completion
    reposition cursor to error
    for parameters, facility for special edit dodads

need a way to tell rect interface to enter move mode with lbdown, as when initialize a child interface

Palettes:
  load palette should have a preview
  allow editing palette strips, import those to gradient tools
  custom palettes
  if height < 2*textheight, then hide name info
  wheel between loaded palettes?
  have a none color
  right click for:
    load palette
	select palette
	save palette
	dup palette
	New from a generator (like rainbow)
Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window
    -->delay until proper color implementation in place
gradient resources
  owner: file/user global/system global
  name
  tags
  color strip: stops
    position
    color

improve split window
  control wheel to expand bevel
  load/save split bevel settings
  restore mouse cursor change when over gap
  simplify pane customization, docking

page thumbnail should be rational, ie image should be whole page, not just contents+transform,
	 and thumb transform makes image dims to page coords

Signature editor:
  mixing different page sizes mixes up the PageLayout at boundaries. alignment should be either always centered, or custom
  after you add stack, the added one should be selected
  must implement dragging around instance blocks...
  helper controls to adjust inset to match up final size for sigs of different size
  indicators for different signature instances when viewing page spreads
  need to be able to designate particular sheets with properties (like color),
    as current insert mechanism assumes folds happen before insert
  tab to cycle through handles for numerical input
  mouse over and drag show numbers on canvas
  export pdf or lo doc template
  implement work and turn interface
  needs visual dodads to indicate where to drag to change, give tooltip to say shift for fold under.
  binding edge must be same orientation for all stacks and inserts
  need a paper size editor stand alone window, entering numbers should convert name to custom
  paper select should give hints as to whether paper size can hold actual final size
  detect non staplable binding edge, show red rather than green
  test impose-only for all imposition types
  show margin, trim, binding when not totally folded
  be able to specify single sided.. allows bound accordian foldings?

printer mark rendering default to a single color? editing of net outline allowed, but
then changes not stored

shortcut dialog:
  mode for shortcut check not quite working, such as ' ' with button to duplicate
  need hierarchy overlap features... it is easy to get lost in different zones
  panning f'd up, close but incorrect bounds checking when drag
  needs to make in window for cursor moving
  numberpadmask?
  char names for wacky xf86 codes.. accept 0x*
  area heads need to have human titles, _("Image Tool") instead of "ImageInterface"
  mode based shortcuts have no display capability
  implement search
  need ability to add multiple keys for same action
  svg keyboard out

reimpose option: center images, but not rescale?

have option to specify language from command line

add menu items to rulercornermenu for reseting view orientation

move impose-only attributes to newdoc/export dialog or otherwise somehow give access to all imposition stuff
	feed it an ExportConfig

standardize new Impositions: each has:
   interface OR window editor
   class type
   default resources
  possible to define other editors for any imposition type
  
autorecover.. autosave every X minutes

make "make uninstall" work, and remove coop 

merge set and ValueHash?

review Imposition types:
  each has:
    class
	interface and/or editor

Masking
    pathinterface conversion must be done
    true object tree with all lax data objects subclassed to hold children, and reference parent

wacom tablet or other x device customizing

need device editor, detect wacom pad buttons.. they are available as an xlib mouse

make pdf default output format for sending to lp

Spread Editor:
  debug select spreads with rectangle
  update page label type to be color+shape, shape being circle, square, diamond, or triangle
    default colors: white, gray, dark gray, black, red, yellow
  insert blanks before or after
  after an insert, have temp wheelable number indicator, update on screen
  modify page labels gui, double click on a page label, where ever it might be... select pages in spread editor
  integration of page label gui with spreadeditor, select pages, pop up the dialog?
  adjust page preview size
  debug spread threads and page groups
  create new document from spread view

importing should not spawn new windows
importing should sort out duplicate names
import vector should default to current page import

custom tools:
  scripted
  normal tools, but jump to special settings for those tools..

implement marks
  bleed marks
  color bars from a palette
  spread info: spread type, current date and time, creator, spread number/total number of spreads

turning off overlays should revert icon to current tool

debug multi head? seems to crash when showing with projectors plugged in
	screen info should return x,y,w,h, with flag saying it is part of a whole.
	if only one screen, then x,y is 0

for range on import/export, should have a range parser that accepts unconnected ranges, ie "2,4, 5-10"

for clones, it would be easier to have a "defs" group or something, so deleting the original of a ref will
  not cause problems. When deleting objects, must then take care to update parent, so it is immediately known
  if an object is without a home.

PathEditor: 
  shift click down then up on a point selects then deselects
  draggable width changer
    drag bar to position on line
	drag arrow to adjust width, move arrows symmetrically
	shift drag adjust offset, move both arrows
	control drag, adjust only one arrow
  copy and paste
  cut segment
  maybe dotted connection if only both end points selected, click connection to close?
  maybe control when on vertex will create whichever handle does not exist, control nearest drag point determines which is created
  make straight bez
  make straight line
  not show every single handle. only ones associated with active vertices, show unactive vertices with small circles
  align nodes -> create temp set of data to pass to AlignInterface?
  transform handles for nodes, including flip
  subdivide, repeat key press restores old segment, then adds 1 more point to num of points from last press
  toggle between add points / select points?
    if add points, show dotted line to indicate a new segment incoming
  finish new path/pathoperator/pathsubinterface/pathinterface structure

Scribus:
  import/export color meshes, for recent versions of Scribus
  import/export linear and radial gradients
  scribus in/out: font sizes, stroke widths
  import should try to apply the Scribus layout correctly, at least for 2 page spreads
  import should do something meaningful with original Scribus page bleed values

in number edit boxes, wheel should allow changing numbers, change on digit mouse is over!
  is it better to wheel at curpos?? probably.. select that digit, must track after changes!!!

paperinterface:
   paperinterface: in spread editor (done), and able to print it out, don't forget to remove DBG for release!
   options to show order of papers, print all of one size paper first? auto sort order by size? auto wrap image?
   Load, save, add, delete paper groups
   papergroups:
    work out scheme for resource ownership: they can be owned by:
      1.DONE  Document: if no project, save with document by default
      2.DONE  Project:  save in project file
      3.or Global resource: save in ~/.laidout/version/papergroups
          class FileRef 
        papergroup->owner=Document, Project, or FileRef
   paperinterface:
     no doc, define papergroup, convert papergroup to singles pages?
     orient viewport to paper
     snap other papers to various boxes
     double click to edit paper details
     in spread editor (done), and able to print it out
     more versatile size control per paper
     edit window? should be edit on screen....
        Name:  default single letter
        Paper: Letter, 8.5/11, landscape
        Box: Media [v]   Box: Clip [v]
                            [ ] None
           0 0 8.5 11       X: 0   Y: 0
                          W: 8.5 H: 11
        [delete paper type][new paper type]

saving when net is internal is not proper.. does not distinguish between diff. nets and whole

import config generic things like enum keepmystery should be parsed when no import config given!!

ungroup should have ungrouped objects selected after ungrouping

in laxkit, key and mouse state should already be filtered to only contain laxkit modifiers,
reserve names for CommandMask (macs), and a few other custom masks for other weird keyboards

need createImportConfig/createExportConfig to make ImportConfig/ExportDocumentConfig objects
from parameters for all filters....

mass image edit, need to remap dirs for old files!!

export should have option to export in segments, like 4 pages at a time, but export all

overwrite should return to file dialog if no

scribus out doesn't do gradients

bleeding mechanism should be functional

option to use different go/don't go colors

plugin for easy antiprism import

pdf optimize jpg dump, compress image data

animated beacons for anchor points to make them visible

double click on group should change selection area to group contents?
    need to clarify how grouping operates. Perhaps implement sets at same time
    clearCurobj() with skim to group for group->double click?

Svg: in/out of meshes

add --experimental option to activate any crash prone features not otherwise available

object select, 'a' toggle select or not, select all in current selection area (ie page or layer base)

'm' should be able to move whole groups, means must be in object tool?

For objects that appear very small, the drag handles should not be operable.. shift only

When there are errors or warnings in exporting, should be able to have the error log such that
  you can just jump to the offending bit easily. This would also be used for preflight verifiers,
  and maybe also mass edit things, like edit all images..
  - have ViewWindow::JumpToObject(&place, objectid);	

align tool:
  endpoints should be oriented triangle, not circles which make it look like path nodes
  explode in normal align
  should be able to scale and rotate a non-line path when not in path mode
  need manual mode.. drag grid marks to position manually... have that option available on others, auto transform to auto
  gap looks ugly.. have indicator highlight path itself, drag that around
  would be VERY handy to be able to recall previous arrangements, so you can partially redo 
  final layout options: unoverlap -> possibly snap to path, then spread out on path to not overlap
  extra custom finishing per object?
  reorder on layouts? -> how to handle reorder in gap and unoverlap?
    trace out order path... show with numbers
  drag out path, order of intersection is new object order?
  maybe grid drag control to reorder
  snapping to 0/50/100
  number box while dragging, goes away after a second, or click on it to edit
    if inc/dec arrows, have it inc or dec the decimal place cursor is on
  default presets: inkscape crossover

nup:
  flowed
  unclump
  unoverlap -> define strategy, either shift H, Vert, along v, or shift on axes between objects
  object reorder
  scale panel should allow mpx and control zoom around point

should have easy way to save as a template

when you try to open anything in ~/.laidout/*/templates, then it should open as a template 

select region by intersect, not by corner inclusion...

Object tool:
  maybe show flip and 90 deg rotate handles only when mouse outside the selection area?
  control-move flip line to snap to horizontal, vertical, 45 deg, or common gravity points

action/shortcut selector overlay

importing images should default the image id to a variant of the file name

ImageImport dialog: (actually, needs a total redesign)
  DONE  file bookmarks!!!!! NOW!! auto one for examples, or save as template
  Choose/Review tabbed window
  horizontal stack frame between choose/review and preview window
  fancier path selector
  for preview field, show green or something and change tooltip if preview will get generated
  click on file to preview file, preview to preview preview
  generate image previews progress box...
  autogenerate should do special check for ~/.thumbnails to conform to freedesktop spec size and type...
  importimages-> eps --> they are fit into boxes!! they should maybe be inserted into a stream..

dynamic objects (generated images, dynamic images, rendered images)
    eps objects to pdf: export as image, plant in PDF as image
    group objects with laidout elements, updateable with script
    image objects using ImageImportFilters
    perhaps add TEX_BIN, LATEX_BIN, and text editor to quickly add stuff like that!!
    external commands:
      website to recommend learn more
      needs what type of file
      needs how many files
      needs what other info
In image properties dialog, have the popup list of potential previews
    preview style needs debugging and testing so as not to fry the freedesktop ones
if you change an eps to a non eps with the insert file, it still thinks it is an eps..
 image objects should auto change between the available image formats:
  bitmap--eps--embedded svg--dynamic
  Dynamic Content:
    displayed as images, or displayed as group of laidout objects
    possibly multiple images or objects in linked list:
      one source creates multipage ps, for instance, each page gets its own object
    controller source object:
      generator command + context
   examples:
    ps/tex/pdf/etc to eps files, import the eps files
    broken down equirect panorama to net
Image import chain:
  1. eps|EPS: Laidout builtin
  2. svg|SVG: inkscape command line export
  3. other external renderer: asymptote, structure synth, sunflow, pov-ray, lilypond, latex, graphviz, gnuplot
  3. * images: graphicsmagick
  4. jpg, png, gif, tiff: Imlib2

Finish implementing project based setup, particularly being able to save a project, not just load one   
    need option to choose midstream to save as project, or individual documents
    DONE separate project->filename from project directory, in case you just want a
            convenient project file floating around without the whole mess of a project directory..
            either that, or zip up the project directory inside the "project file"..
    collect for out type of option
    finish generic style edit window for quick dialog creation
    need to puzzle out decent way to build dialogs, maybe have dialog building hints embedded in the styledefs
    (temp) iron out what happens on ^s and ^+s, and where docs get saved: with project or otherwise
     New Proj:
       DONE  must create Project Directory...
       DONE  new documents should default to saving in that directory
       TEST if file is in project dir, then path is saved relative, else is absolute
       saving not saving windows properly
       Always copy outside files to project directory
       [help] ---> pop up brief explanation of what a project entails
     Load/Save: (mixed documents and projects)
       DONE  open as copy button (just like templates)
       DONE  [Open][Open as a Copy]
       preview laidout Doc and Project files: show some info about them...
         Project: Some_Project.laidout, 1 day old
         Project: Someotherproject,     5 days old
         Document: Some Doc
         Document: Some other doc
       remember this many recent: __20__

When importing from an image list file, should be able to say if and when to auto-make previews
    new option in file, should be easy

mystery data enhancement: import as placeholder objects: if convertible to laidout elements, do not actually
                expose them as such. Keep source in external location, current laidout only rearranges.
                  ---> this is same as import as image, but using laidout objects to render them with, not bitmap images
                  ---> this is useful to have a standard object indicator built from laidout objects, but
                         do not let them be editable

really should have option to separate or merge resources when multiple documents open, rather than
always merge?

papersizes are not translated. Should they be??

how best to integrate Styles, Attributes, and Values??? style types:
 Laidout
 Project
 Document
 Page
 Group
  draw objects: Image, ImagePatch, Paths, Path, LinearGradient, RadialGradient, PatchGradient
 PaperGroup
 PaperType
 Imposition: Singles, DSS, Booklet, Signature, Net:Box, Dod, etc...
 ImageImportFilter
 ImportFilter:svg,ppt,sla,ps,eps,odraw
 ExportFilter
-->Styles are Values that can be cascaded from other Styles
   Values cannot be cascaded
-->C++ classes represent data that can be accessed and modified through:
     onscreen
	 file saved to disk
	 interpreter
   would be advantageous to write a single object def, and output options and documention to
   each of the 3 targets

                                    
Tools should remember their settings
    figure out which settings need to be remembered, and install as resource.. what happens when diff
     windows are using diff tools? which settings are remembered? have tool styles that are saved, as
     well as the running tool use settings

Net imposition
  net extra scaling non-functional
  NetImposition needs import/export net,
  export svg
  convert to/from laidout elements
  interactive unwrapper and build net interface figure out bleeding and connectivity infrastructure
  figure out more efficient clipping of Imlib images

hedron window:
  send imp
  receive imp
  need to draw other nets in outline (at least) in paper view
  need to preview sides on hedron
  memory hole in polyptych
  DONE proper units for papers

  need to implement more options for polyhedron connections, to allow mobius strips...


global resources:
  current frame/time
  current language, for conditional text

external tools:
  to image renderers
  to object renderers
  Image editor (gimp, krita)
  plain text editor (gvim, console vim, command, etc)
  associate (object type) <-> (external editor)

> laidout blah.laidout...     <-- if starting like this, if blah.laidout does not exist, then abort
> laidout 1.laidout 2.laidout <-- if starting like this, if either exist, then start up, but have 
                                    warning message that one document failed to load?
	-> could have a consumable message interface? show a message until the box is clicked on, then it removes itself?

textobjects,limbos,papergroups should maybe be able to be stored per document, not just file, project, or temp
either that, or do away with whole project/document difference, and use only 
projects with their own directory, and projects without their own directory
Selected region out to image(s), regions optionally remembered
    rectangle or path?

import/export styledefs should use the extendsdef mechanism!!!

plain text edit window specify interpreter to process the text with

filters:
  svg out: radial:transparent inner circle, patch
             patch edges
  remember last export

Clean up mesh/patch controls
  nudge mode with shift?
  smooth edit mode should be default. It's not working
  rotate/scale single control point should move attached controls in smooth mode
  add new patches should smoothify joins when in smooth edit
  rect select nodes
  selected nodes are not clearly indicated
  for cache preview, only update affected patches
  changing recurse and rendermode in patch controls doesn't change that setting in the instance that does random rendering!!

need infrastructure to propagate and save tool settings

pointin should check to visual boundary, not bounding box (? maybe just optionally)

perhaps split radial and linear gradients to different tools? makes more sense

all at once imposition... this would allow mapping of scribus layout without fuss. that
  could be a special case of n-up, where you specify n to be infinity, with m number of
  columns, not necessarily aligned, as scribus does.

pagerangeinterface: need overlay close box.. need to add feature to ViewerWindow to have not
				    just tools but overlays. Any number of overlays can be active, but only one tool
  edit base in place
  should not be able to shift overlay offscreen entirely.. maybe if dragging offscreen, minimize on corner?
  should remember old label format strings, to easily select back to them

For objects that are really skinny, it is not practical to have the handles be a percentage of the skinny
  part.. should have minimum drag areas?

from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS especially when dialogs are up
    focus off a dialog, then refocus, must manually set control focus. should store which subwindow
     gets the focus when autofocused.

searchable menus

messages to the status line should have priorities, so once mouse over messages are cleared, it would revert
  back to a lower priority message



===================Anything below here probably needs discussion before implementing================
---------------------------------- other enhancements ----------------------------------
how to keep track of class hierarchy? impositions are now listed by resource instance, what is
  best way of keeping track of base imposition classes? this is needed for file format description output

for translations, there is a difference between locale translations and language translations!
  not sure if it is worth paying attention to... need to investigate if locale as it affects keyboard input
  is separate from what locale we read in translations from. If it is distinguishable, that is fabulous, in that
  we can maintain the current locale key input, but change the language translation at will...

investigate pdfcreator as method to reduce file size

distribute tool

n-up tool

repeater tool on path: could be adapted to help animation tweening

DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of rect regions (2-d guides)
    would also implement the dump into Limbo
	dump into any string of objects, this is really the same thing as laying out a stream, maybe merge this?

measure tool.. configure measurements to be:
 displayer units
 object units
 units mapped to either type of units, so can use light years for units that are actually inch physical paper units
have arrows, and write on screen what the size is...

impositions:
  for printing/exporting non-paper layouts, should have option to specify what sort of paper
   or paper net is proper to hold the layout... means:
   paperstyle=imposition->Paper(layout);
   imposition return a spread with flag for if papergroup is for printing or printing and viewing

importimages: remember last settings

Laidout file preview: give a few relevant info bits, by parsing only part of the file

object selection:
 shift on a selected object should remove that object from selection
 would be nice to show what would be selected during rect-dragout
change object that is part of group object does not force remap of bbox of group

clean up and test:
--export-options format  List all the options for the given format
--print  'from=3; to=32; layout=pages; printer=epson-usb/matte360'
  same as:
--export 'filter="Postscript LL3"  from=3  to=32  layout=pages  command="lp -d epson-usb/matte360"'

pdf export:
 page labels

Import image list: default previews


export with limbo, and no doc or papergroup, means use bounding box for limbo?


when importing, have MysteryData, which has special attributes "@file-pos" which says
 where in the original file the attribute starts:
 MysteryData
   transform/bounds
   title (shown in screen)
   description
   file format the data is from
   attribute style listing of the object? or straight from file
 in: convert file to attributes, or provide method to tailor to an output format (eps, pdf objs, raster image),
         and provide a preview image or object to stand in for the file..


limbo transform should be obeyed. It can be moved, scaled, etc,
page layers should be simplified, each layer behaves according to its transform, and more controls inserted to handle layer maneuvering

impositions:
 Name                  Abbr.       Folds     Leaves    Pages
 Folio                  fo, f        1         2         4
 Quarto                 4to          2         4         8
 Sexto, Sixmo           6to, 6mo     3         6        12
 Octavo                 8vo          3         8        16
 Duodecimo, Twelvemo    12mo         4        12        24
 Sextodecimo, Sixteenmo 16mo         4        16        32

Net:
 save different setups: papertile AND net layout
 load save nets from: 1.net files or 2.OFF files(done)

LaxFiles::ColorAttribute()
default: make list of as many as there are in segment, if name has 'f' then assume float,
 if lettersNumber, then number is num of bits UNLESS it is 100
general: rgb     65535 0 0
         rgb_8   255   0 0
         rgb_100 100.0 0 0
         rgba_8  255   0 0 255
         rgb_16  65535 0 0
         rgba_f  1.0 0 0 1.0
         gray    65535
         graya_f 1.0 1.0
         cmy
         cmyk
         cmykaf
         hex    ffff0000ffff
         hex8   ffffff
         rgbx   0xffffff

need conversions: gradient->color patch
                  image -> imagepatch
                  imagepatch -> image
                  colorpatch -> image?

remember tool settings: double click on tool icon? right click...
remember tool settings

configurable command buttons to automate certain things with minimal window clutter....

int SomeData::Compatible(const char *withwhat)
NO!!!!! compatibility should be determined by object type managers, not individual objects
return if object is currently compatible with some standard, 
like "PS LL3", "EPS 3.0", "SVG 1.2", "PDF 1.3", "PDF 1.4" "HTML/CSS2"
1==yes, straight out
2==yes, but needs rasterizing
this would simplify preflight checking

dump OUT an image list? Scribus has "review images" feature.. can jump to location, edit print/view, etc

Saving: multiple documents open, save only the headwindows that refer only to that doc,
OR save no window configs (saved with project), OR save custom configs

directory reorganization?
 windows/ <-- purely ui elements
 core/ <-- implies isolating core functions




paper tiler: for custom pages, drag out a paper size

intl support: ready for pango?

template/master pages: 
 have objects be tagged with ref object, so you can create a page with a master page
  that has a "text frame" for instance, but different children per page

rulercornerbutton:
  Insert v
    Pagetemplate1
    template2

a "Place" tool like indesign?? preview images and place by dragging out one by one, as well
 as optionally into Arrangements

NetImposition:
    import/export cff2?
    export vrml? pdf 1.6?


file format prettification
  adapt the scribus xml/att convertor to parse the output of laidout --file-format
  into something meaningful...
  #-------blah--------  <- mark a new section
    thing      #thing's docs
      subthing #subthing's docs
    #docs for following atts indented same as previous atts
    next_att #(one or more) next_att docs


======================================DONE=================================================
When releasing new version, combine these with ROADMAP items for release notes.
These can then be purged after each release...
