Interfaces that are not particularly tied to specific object types should go in here.
Interfaces that are for specific DrawableObject types should go in ../dataobjects.

Add Makefile dependency in the "objs" list, then refresh dependency map with "make depends"

To have your interface actually available, you must add creation code in ../interfaces.cc.
