How to create a new filter
--------------------------

There are Import filters and Export filters. When running, there will be
one instance of each file format and version. For instance there will
be one export filter for  PDF 1.4 and another one for PDF 1.3.

Filters can define their own configuration dialogs if they wish, or
they can use the default dialog generated based on the filter's
StyleDef (unimplemented, todo!!).

Filters should follow the following guidelines.


Export Filters
--------------
If an ExportFilter can export many pages to the same file, it must have 
FILTER_MULTIPAGE set in its flags. 

If the filter can export each spread or paper
to many files, then it must have FILTER_MANY_FILES set. If it cannot export
to many files, and you try to do so, then export_document() will loop
over each spread and paper, creating one file per spread per paper.

Export filters are called from export_document(), which does some basic
verification on the export configuration, so that filters may assume
that start<=end, that doc or limbo can be NULL, but not both, and that
papergroup is not NULL and does not need to be changed at all.

export_document() will also ensure that the PaperGroup is not NULL,
by using if necessary the default PaperGroup for the Document's
Imposition, or if the Document is NULL, a default single paper is
used. Otherwise, the given PaperGroup must override the Document Imposition's
PaperGroup, and will be applied to each spread in the specified range,
even for spreads identified as paper layouts. If there is no PaperGroup given,
and no Imposition PaperGroup specified for the desired layout type, then
a default paper is used.

One may export Document objects, and/or more general drawable objects. When
a filter is called, it is passed a reference to a Document, PaperGroup,
and a Group object. If the Document and 
Group objects are both given, then the Group is assumed to be a limbo
object, and must be drawn before (that is, under) any Document spreads.

If no Document is given, then the start, end, and layout type passed
to the filter are to be ignored.


Import Filters
--------------
Import should be performed in such a way as to preserve as much as possible the
data that was in the original file so that an ImportFilter's companion 
ExportFilter can take that preserved original data, and export it back
into that file format properly.

This magical feat is preformed vie MysteryData objects, and MysteryAttributes
attached to a Document.
