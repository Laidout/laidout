LAIDOUT TODO

See src/TODO and the doxygen produced todo list in docs/html/todo.html






//-----------------------------------------------
Note to self: When Compiling and packaging, REMEMBER:
install in different dirs for different versions
the binary should be laidout-version, with a link from 'laidout' to it.
Any supporting files /usr/local/share/laidout/* (of which there are none currently)
should go in /usr/local/share/laidout/version/*?
