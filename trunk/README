WHAT IT CAN DO RIGHT NOW
------------------------
Laidout is currently in the 'Kind of a hack, but mostly works
on my machine' stage of development.

You can rearrange stuff on pages.. The fancy page spread editor
is sort of working, you can shift pages around pretty easily.
Many of the features are only partially implemented, and the
real meat of the program is only half in place right now.

You can export as Passepartout files, but only the images will
export. You can 'print' to a postscript file or eps files. Printable
things are images, linear, radial, and bezier patch color gradients.
Path printing is badly implemented currently.

Laidout and the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net) each share
some of the burden of the 'meat', but anyway...


COMPILING
---------

Ensure that you have the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net)
available. For the Laidout development version, you will need the
Laxkit development version from the same date. Laidout expects 
Imlib2 support to have been compiled into the Laxkit. Make sure 
that Laxkit headers are in the place specified by the LAXDIR variable
in the file Makefile-toinclude, then type:

make
make install

There is no 'configure' at the moment. 'make install' will put
laidout-(whatever version) in (usually) /usr/local/bin, and make a
symbolic link /usr/local/bin/laidout point to it.

DISTRO WARNING: the Makefiles here are for the development source, which
also tries to do 'make' of the Laxkit, since Laxkit and Laidout are 
so intertwined. Just remove those parts of the Makefiles
if you want to compile only Laidout.

After successfully making, the program 'laidout' in the src
directory is the thing you want. It does not depend on any other
files currently, thus it can be run from wherever it is located.

Running the program might spit out copious amounts of debugging
info. If this is the case, you can turn this off with 'make hidegarbage'
before doing 'make' (the same goes for the Laxkit). Or, you can just 
run the program like this:

./laidout > /dev/null


SOURCE DOCUMENTATION and CONTRIBUTING
-------------------------------------

There is a lot of source documentation available via doxygen, just type:

make docs

and it dumps it all out to docs/html. In particular, you will have a 
rapidly expanding todo list. If you want to contribute, that is a good
place to start. That and the Laxkit todo list.
