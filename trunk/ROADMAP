LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.


VERSION 0.1
-----------
       Of course, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       Load and save window configurations
(done,but needs serious optimizing) Bezier patch with image for the color (this would be HOT for the gimp! a side project..)
       Basic EPS import, would open up all kinds of down and dirty tricks using other progs:latex,lilypond,...
       EPS out to file###.eps by page, spread, or paper
       an About window
       ObjectInterface for selecting and resizing multiple stuff
       PathInterface should finally work right
       Basic infrastructure for most things (except text) should be in place.
       This means some sort of basic scripting infrastructure,
       undo
       configurable buttons with icons
       parent/child nesting and masking,
       interface for that: nesting, and grouping
       allow for easy method for runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented
       a real PrintDialog
       Generic style edit window
       command prompt window
       plain text edit window for notes/scripts/whatever save with project or doc or its own file
       A style manager, which is Not dependent on laxkit::refcounter
       non-hacky new document box
       also means all things must define their styledefs
       Allow for window docking, floating, etc.
       plus configurable icon panel/menu system
       Page Ranges controlling page number label and which imposition should lay it out
       DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of positions
       perhaps have image open window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
(done) if an image is selected, should be able to import an image to it
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       libintl support
       PDF out, and/or use ghostscripts alleged ability to do transparent images in postscript files
(done) printing: produce masked images based on 50% threshhold of alpha channel of images
       start thinking about the transplanting of the SpreadEditor to Inkscape, in expectation
          of multipage-ness with SVG 1.2, or possibly to scribus also as plugin(?)
(done) When loading files from the command line, should understand: 'file:///path/to/it'
       NetImposition needs much beefing up: import/export net, build net, interactive unwrapper
       SpreadEditor: should be able to drag a page to a view window to change to it, or dblclick
       SpreadEditor: be able to eject a page into limbo, in addition to swap and slide
       SpreadEditor: optionally work with whole spreads, rather than just single pages
       from laxkit: clean up and beef up SplitWindow
       from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS
       from laxkit: related to focus handling: clean up pop up menus which currently REALLY SUCK
(done) Whoops! Change reference from LGPL to GPL in source code!! Crap!!


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
The other Postscript LL3 gradients: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow pure function gradients, and redefining the functions for the other gradients..
import/export as possible: passepartout (out is partially done)?,scribus?,svg
Freehand drawing with tablet support
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
layout inside anything that provides an 'area' and runaround facility.
Also most likely means finally deciding on a rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? freetype/pango?
  which also means start to do serious optimizing for docs with a billion big images in them
Seriously optimize the whole ImagePatchData stuff
ImageMagick plugin: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to be able to handle metapost sort of things
Would be nice to be able to handle lilypond sort of things
Load/save various gimp things like gradients, palettes, and paths, perhaps extract from xcf
Story editor


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Evaporate my student loans
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
