LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.


VERSION 0.02 - released 8 April 2006!
------------
(done) Rename Disposition to Imposition. Why oh why did I call it Disposition??
(done) Insert some way to turn off debug info dumped to cout (done in a convoluted way, perhaps)
(done) Linear Gradients edit, save, and printout
(done) Circle Gradients edit, save, and printout
(done) Color patches should work better than in 0.01
(done) Overall windowing setup using Laxkit::SplitWindows, 
(done) from laxkit: replacement of 'datastack' should be complete, do same here
(done) Popup tool selector
(done) ObjectInterface for resizing and shearing
(done) Make Save/Save As dialog box suck less: 'test/1.doc' should mean cd test, save '1.doc'
(done) Make it easy to make deb packages from source
(done) extremely basic print dialog: print to file (ask on overwrite) or send via shell command
(done) make the directory spot in viewer keep updated current directory
(done) debug SpreadEditor thumbnail updating, and clip thumb to page
(done) A help button to popup a list of all the otherwise unmentioned key shortcuts
(done) Debug 'Delete Page'
(done) Button for pageclips
(done) Implement SpreadEditor Reset button

VERSION 0.1
-----------
       Of course, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       Bezier grid patch with image, rather than color (this would be HOT for the gimp! a side project..)
       an About button
       ObjectInterface for selecting and resizing multiple stuff
       PathInterface should finally work right
       Basic infrastructure for most things (except text) should be in place.
       This means some sort of basic scripting infrastructure,
       command prompt window
       undo
       configurable buttons with icons
       parent/child nesting and masking,
       interface for that: nesting, and grouping
       runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented
       a real PrintDialog
       Generic style edit window
       non-hacky new document box
       also means all things must define their styledefs
       Allowing for docking, floating, etc.
       plus configurable icon panel/menu system
       CompositeImposition should be ready
       DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of positions
          perhaps have image open window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
          if an image is selected, should be able to import an image to it
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       libintl support
       PDF out, and/or use ghostscripts ability to do transparent images in postscript files
       start thinking about the transplanting of the SpreadEditor to Inkscape, in expectation
          of multipage-ness with SVG 1.2, or possibly to scribus also
       When loading files from the command line, should understand: 'file:///path/to/it'
       NetImposition needs much beefing up: import/export net, build net, interactive unwrapper
       SpreadEditor: should be able to drag a page to a view window to change to it, or dblclick
       SpreadEditor: be able to eject a page into limbo, in addition to swap and slide
       SpreadEditor: optionally work with whole spreads, rather than just single pages
       from laxkit: clean up and beef up SplitWindow
       from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
The other Postscript LL3 gradients: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow pure function gradients, and redefining the functions for the other gradients..
import/export as possible: passepartout (out is partially done)?,scribus?,svg
Freehand drawing with tablet support
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
  layout inside any path and runaround facility.
Also most likely means finally deciding on a rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? freetype/pango?
  which also means start to do serious optimizing for docs with a billion big images in them
ImageMagick plugin: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to be able to handle metapost sort of things
Would be nice to be able to handle lilypond sort of things
Load/save various gimp things like gradients, palettes, and paths, perhaps extract from xcf


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Evaporate my student loans
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
