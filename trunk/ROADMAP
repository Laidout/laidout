LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.


VERSION 0.01
------------
Clean up web page a bit.

(done) TILING MUST WORK!!!!!!! for booklets also 
(done) Get NetDisposition sort of going
       Implement page clipping for display AND for printing..
(done) Images should work well
       Color patches should work well
(done) in the laxkit: menuselector,
(done) tooltips IMPORTANT!!,
(done) and set said tooltips for the mystery numbers in ViewWindow 
       Add copyright notice to source files


VERSION 0.1
-----------
PathInterface should finally work right
Linear Gradients
Circle Gradients
Basic infrastructure for most things should be in place.
This means some sort of basic scripting infrastructure,
parent/child nesting and masking,
interface for that nesting, and grouping
ObjectInterface for selecting multiple stuff
PrintDialog
Generic style edit window which allows:
  non-hacky new document box
  also means all things must define their styledefs
Overall windowing setup using Laxkit::SplitWindows, docking, etc.
from laxkit: replacement of 'datastack' should be complete, do same here
CompositeDisposition should be ready
DumpImages within Arrangements 
Plugin infrastructure should be in place
Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
PDF out


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Freehand drawing with tablet support
Full color management implemented
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
 layout inside any path and runaround facility.
 Also most likely means finally deciding on a rendering backend
ImageMagick plugin: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
