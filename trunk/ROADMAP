LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.



VERSION 0.05
------------
(done) Be able to work with preview images, rather than hundreds of 15M tiffs
(done) Show adjacent pages in Net Singles view (prelude to being able to unwrap shapes any way they can)
(done) Use a ~/.laidout/0.05/laidoutrc
       SpreadEditor: re-fix auto arranging
(done) ObjectInterface for selecting and resizing multiple stuff
       Import images from a list file
(done) Make ImageInterface scaling suck less, and distinguish between no image and broken image
(done) autoconfiscate or cmake or (this one)have simple "configure" thingy
(done) Should be able to 'Open Document' without restarting Laidout!!
(done) Improve internal icon management


VERSION 0.06
------------
       parent/child nesting and interface for that: nesting, and grouping: layer trees
       Abandon the "laidout-general" mailing list, and create instead a "laidout" mailing list?
       Build a features.html for the webpage
       Find and fix the damn memory hole (at least it currently slowly eats memory rather than crashing)
       from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS especially when dialogs are up
       from laxkit: related to focus handling: clean up pop up menus which currently REALLY SUCK
       from laxkit: fix tooltips: seems laxkit accidentally allows multiple tooltips occasionally
       Basic (opaque) EPS import, would open up all kinds of down and dirty tricks using other progs:latex,lilypond,...
       Be able to work with preview images more easily, and implement all preview config options
       Finish implementing project based setup, especially when loading and saving
       perhaps have image open window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
       PathInterface must be drastically improved, and bez part should have segment move like inkscape
       Change cursor to indicate what will happen as mouse moves around
       

VERSION 0.1
-----------
       When adjusting things with the object tool, must have option to be temporarily a little tranparent
       group combine properties, like most importantly transparency
       Of course, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       Image and Color patches, gradients, etc should allow transparent colors
       Make the button box actually function
       plus configurable icon panel/menu system
       Print all/current paper/paper range, by singles, page layout, or paper layout to ps, eps, pdf, or image
       Linear guides
       DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of positions (2-d guides)
       Parent masking of children
       Fix non-centerfold page bleeding in booklets/doublesidedsingles when printing
       for laxkit: SplitWindow: tabbed panes
       Seriously optimize the whole ImagePatchData stuff
       Have imagepatch be a transform you can apply to any image
       Allow objects to have any number of various kinds of transforms applied to it
       NetImposition needs much beefing up: import/export net, build net, interactive unwrapper
       Basic infrastructure for most things (except text) should be in place.
       Fully configurable shortcuts, with optional multi-key shortcuts
       Some sort of basic scripting infrastructure allowing easy addition of other scripting language plugins,
       allow for easy method for runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented, with up to 16 bit per channel color
       undo/redo
       a real PrintDialog
       Generic style edit window
       plain text edit window for notes/scripts/whatever save with project or doc or its own file
       Make commands actually available in the command prompt window
       non-hacky new document box
       also means all things must define their styledefs
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       libintl support
       PDF in/out, and/or use ghostscripts alleged ability to do transparent images in postscript files
       start thinking about the transplanting of the SpreadEditor to Inkscape, in expectation
          of multipage-ness with SVG 1.2, or possibly to scribus also as plugin(?)
       SpreadEditor: be able to eject a page into limbo, in addition to swap and slide
       SpreadEditor: optionally work with whole spreads, rather than just single pages
       Provide some kind of visual feedback while doing lengthy operations
       Finish implementing booklet/double sided vertical, and BasicBookImposition
       Improve and/or make new logo and splash image
       have an image in the little pan popups
       Have special function to output to file a pseudocode mockup of the file format
       Combine the ViewWindow and SpreadEditor to allow the sort of 'infinite scroll'
       Be able to interact with patches in a way reminiscent of Inkscape's node sculpting
       Be able to have paper objects in addition to the normal page objects (ie master page numbers)
       Use the freedesktop recommended ~/.recently-used (on laxkit's todo also)


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
The other Postscript LL3 gradients: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow pure function gradients, and redefining the functions for the other gradients..
import/export as possible: passepartout (out is partially done)?,scribus?,svg,tiff,png,etc
Freehand drawing with tablet support
Somehow be able to do foldouts from within any page of an imposition
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
layout inside anything that provides an 'area' and runaround facility.
Also most likely means finally deciding on a real rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? freetype/pango?
ImageMagick plugin or integration: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to be able to handle metapost sort of things
Would be nice to be able to handle lilypond sort of things
Load/save various gimp/inkscape/etc things like gradients, palettes, and paths, perhaps extract from/to xcf
Maybe have ability to break apart and use parts of gimp.xcf/inkscape.svg/scribus.sla, and put them back in?
Story editor
Internal generic impositioner for arbitrary .ps files
Cooperate with photo programs like KPhotoalbum
Make nets cooperate with Hugin/Enblend
Vx (aka uberconvertor) support?


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Evaporate my student loans
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
