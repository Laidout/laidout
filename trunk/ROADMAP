LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.


VERSION 0.01 -- released 12 March 2006!
------------
(done) Clean up web page a bit.
(done) TILING MUST WORK!!!!!!! for booklets also 
(done) Get NetDisposition sort of going
(done) Implement page clipping for display AND for printing..
(done) Images should work well
(done) Color patches should work enough to be getting on with
(done) in the laxkit: menuselector,
(done) tooltips IMPORTANT!!,
(done) and set said tooltips for the mystery numbers in ViewWindow 
(done) Add copyright notice to source files
(done) Add and Delete Page buttons
(done) Throw together a quick key-stroke cheat sheet

VERSION 0.02
------------
(done) Rename Disposition to Imposition. Why oh why did I call it Disposition??
(done) Insert some way to turn off debug info dumped to cout (done in a convoluted way, perhaps)
(done) Linear Gradients edit, save, and printout
(done) Circle Gradients edit, save, and printout
(done) Color patches should work better than in 0.01
(done) Overall windowing setup using Laxkit::SplitWindows, 
(done) from laxkit: replacement of 'datastack' should be complete, do same here
       ObjectInterface for selecting and resizing multiple stuff
       Save/Save as dialog box
	   Make deb package
	   extremely basic print dialog: print to file (ask on overwrite) or send via shell command
	   make the directory spot in viewer keep updated current directory
	   path printing should be use the linestyle, filling will have to wait for 0.1

VERSION 0.1
-----------
       Of course, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       A help button to popup a list of all the otherwise unmentioned key shortcuts
       an About button
       PathInterface should finally work right
       Basic infrastructure for most things should be in place.
       This means some sort of basic scripting infrastructure,
	   command prompt window
       undo
       parent/child nesting and masking,
       interface for that: nesting, and grouping
       runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented
       PrintDialog
       Generic style edit window
       non-hacky new document box
       also means all things must define their styledefs
       Allowing for docking, floating, etc.
       plus configurable icon panel/menu system
       CompositeImposition should be ready
       DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of positions
          perhaps have image open window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       libintl support
       PDF out
       start thinking about the transplanting of the SpreadEditor to Inkscape, in expectation
          of multipage-ness with SVG 1.2, or possibly to scribus also
       When loading files from the command line, should understand: 'file:///path/to/it'
	   NetImposition needs beefing up: import/export net, build net, interactive unwrapper


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
Bezier grid patch with image, rather than color
The other Postscript LL3 gradients: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow function gradients, and redefining the functions for the ps gradients..
import/export as possible: passepartout (out is partially done)?,scribus?,svg
Freehand drawing with tablet support
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
  layout inside any path and runaround facility.
Also most likely means finally deciding on a rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? freetype/pango?
ImageMagick plugin: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to have metapost sort of things
Allow applying user functions to the gradients?


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Evaporate my student loans
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
