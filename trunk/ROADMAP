LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.

General
-------
Make an RSS feed.. can use sourceforge news thing?


VERSION 0.01
------------
(done) Clean up web page a bit.
(done) TILING MUST WORK!!!!!!! for booklets also 
(done) Get NetDisposition sort of going
(done) Implement page clipping for display AND for printing..
(done) Images should work well
(done) Color patches should work enough to be getting on with
(done) in the laxkit: menuselector,
(done) tooltips IMPORTANT!!,
(done) and set said tooltips for the mystery numbers in ViewWindow 
(done) Add copyright notice to source files
(done) Add and Delete Page buttons
(done) Throw together a quick key-stroke cheat sheet


VERSION 0.1
-----------
(done) Rename Disposition to Imposition. Why oh why did I call it Disposition??
(done) Insert compile flag to turn off debug info dumped to cout
       A help button to popup a list of all the otherwise unmentioned key shortcuts
       PathInterface should finally work right
       Linear Gradients
       Circle Gradients
       Color patches should work better than in 0.01
       Basic infrastructure for most things should be in place.
       This means some sort of basic scripting infrastructure,
       parent/child nesting and masking,
       interface for that: nesting, and grouping
	   runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented
       ObjectInterface for selecting and resizing multiple stuff
       PrintDialog
       Generic style edit window which allows:
         non-hacky new document box
         also means all things must define their styledefs
       Overall windowing setup using Laxkit::SplitWindows, docking, etc.
(done) from laxkit: replacement of 'datastack' should be complete, do same here
       CompositeImposition should be ready
       DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of positions
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
	   libintl support
       PDF out
	   start thinking about the transplanting of the SpreadEditor to Inkscape, in expectation
	      of multipage-ness with SVG 1.2, or possibly to scribus also


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Freehand drawing with tablet support
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
 layout inside any path and runaround facility.
 Also most likely means finally deciding on a rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? pango?
ImageMagick plugin: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to have metapost sort of things


VERSION 0.3
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere
Impeach Bush
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Evaporate my student loans
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
