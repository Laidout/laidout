               NEW RELEASES
MAKING LAIDOUT DEB PACKAGE AND SRC TARBALL
----------------------
(if anyone has a better way of doing this, let me know, I'm new at this)

1. Double check that these are current:
  debian/laidout.1
  the ladioutrc description dump out in laidout.cc

2. ----Copy trunk to a new tag------
 svn copy https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/trunk \
          https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(whatever version)
 make sure the Makefile does not try to compile lax

3. ----modify source---
 check out the branch: svn co https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(version)
 make sure version number is correct in any source files that refer to it, currently:
   debian/changelog
   debian/laidout.1              :Version ****, for laying out books
   docs/doxygen/laidoutintro.txt :-- Version ***** --\n
   docs/Doxyfile                 :PROJECT_NUMBER         = *****
   docs/Doxyfile-with-laxkit     :PROJECT_NUMBER         = *****
   configure
   README                        :LAIDOUT Version *****
   all the example docs
 make sure the Quick Key References are accurate. There are separate versions
   of it in ./QUICKREF, debian/laidout.1, and src/helpwindow.cc
 make sure icon directory is set for after install (src/icons.h)?!
 make depends  in the src directory
 
 make sure configure defaults to 'prefix=/usr/local/'. This is what should be in a source tarball
 make sure 'make' does not try to make lax or laxinterfaces unless laxkit has been 
   downloaded into the source tree...
 
 make sure all the examples work, and have the correct version number

4. ---hide the debugging garbage and commit---
 make hidegarbage 
 (make sure same is done for laxkit, as Laidout currently statically
  links against laxkit, which also uses the same system to hide debugging couts)
 svn ci -m'Last minute touchups to this tag'
 
5. Export a copy of the new tag and make a tarball. 
 svn export https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(whichever) laidout-(version)
  If Laxkit is to be included, you should export that to the top laidout dir: 
 svn export https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/trunk laxkit
  then cd to parent dir and do:
 tar cjv (the dir) > laidout-version.tar.bz2 
   this should be the distributed tarball, also

 For dev snapshots, the version should be number-rev[SUBVERSION REVISION], so like 0.02-rev234

6. Prepare for deb packaging
 make sure Makefile has 'prefix=$(DESTDIR)/usr'. This is important for the 'make install'
   part of dpkg-buildpackage's building of the package


7. ---build the package---
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot in top laidout directory

8. don't forget to update the help and screenshots sections on the website
