LAIDOUT Version 0.05.1
--------------------
http://laidout.org


Please post any complaints and other correspondence to the Laidout
general mailing list found at:
https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/laidout-general

Currently the only developer (and creator of Laidout) is also a client:
Tom Lechner <tomlechner@users.sourceforge.net>

WHAT IT CAN DO RIGHT NOW
------------------------
Laidout is currently in the 'Kind of a hack, but mostly works
on my machine' stage of development.

Laidout currently can arrange pages into a couple different impositions,
such as a booklet, or even a dodecahedron. You can manipulate images
and gradients (linear, radial, and bezier patches). Also, 
you can make a type of image that can be stretched around. The very 
basics to get my cartoon books done, in other words. Many more features
are planned, like such non-essentials (to me anyway) as text! Who needs 
text when a picture is worth a thousand words? 

Many of the features are only partially implemented, and the real meat
of the program is only half in place right now. Be advised that you can,
after great hassle, construct paths on screen, but path printing
(to the printer) is badly implemented currently.

Laidout and the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net) each share
some of the burden of the 'meat' of the program, but anyway...


COMPILING
---------

You will need a few extra development libraries on your computer in order
to compile Laidout. Running ./configure does a simple check for these,
but the check is so simple, that it may miss them. You will need the
header files for Imlib2, freetype2, fontconfig, x11, and cups.

Ensure that you have the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net)
available. If you have downloaded a release, then the Laxkit should
have been included.

Here are the current "./configure" options:
 --help                       Show the options you can pass to ./configure
 --prefix=/where/to/install   Default /usr/local
 --gs=/path/to/gs             Where is your ghostscript executable? This is quite
                               optional, and is not planned to be used at all 
                               until version 0.06. Then, it will only be used to
                               generate a preview image of EPS files.
 --laxkit=/laxkit/headers     Default in releases is ./laxkit, since the Laxkit
                               is currently included in release downloads

To compile and install Laidout, just run these three easy steps:

./configure
make
make install

'make install' will put
laidout-(whatever version) in (usually) /usr/local/bin, and make a
symbolic link /usr/local/bin/laidout point to it.

After successfully making, the program 'laidout' in the src
directory is the thing you want. It does not really depend on any other
files currently (except icons, but they are not needed to actually run),
thus it can be run from wherever it is located.


INSTALLING DIFFERENT VERSIONS AT THE SAME TIME
----------------------------------------------

It is quite ok to install different versions of Laidout at the same time.
The ~/.laidout/ directory keeps all the config information in subdirectories
based on the version. The same applies for installed binaries and other
resources that get put in prefix/share/laidout. This way, you do not risk
clobbering or corrupting files from other versions. 

HOWEVER, (todo) work needs to be done on "make uninstall" to not remove 
things that were installed to those directories outside of "make install". 
Right now, everything in prefix/share/laidout will be removed on uninstall
(but not anything in ~/.laidout).

Also, though you can have different versions coexist, there is not currently an
automatic way to convert resources from older laidout versions to newer ones.

In any case, if you can, it's really safer to build the deb package, which 
automatically keeps track of such things.


IF COMPILING FROM SVN
---------------------
For the Laidout development version, you will need the
Laxkit development version from the same date.

The Makefiles here are for the development source, which
also tries to do 'make' of the Laxkit, since Laxkit and Laidout are 
being developed basically side by side. Just remove those parts of the Makefiles
if you want to compile only Laidout.

Note about icons: If you downloaded through svn, the icons need to be 
generated. This requires Inkscape (http://www.inkscape.org)
to generate icons from src/icons/icons.svg, and python to run
the script that calls Inkscape. But, Laidout will work fine without
the icons. Ultimately, the icons will themselves be stored in a Laidout
file, and Laidout itself will generate the icons.
See src/icons/makeimages.py for more.

Running the program might spit out copious amounts of debugging
info if you run from a terminal. If this is the case, you can turn this 
off with 'make hidegarbage' before doing 'make' (the same goes for the 
Laxkit). Be advised that this requires Perl to be installed. Or, you 
can just run Laidout like this:

./laidout > /dev/null


SOURCE DOCUMENTATION and CONTRIBUTING
-------------------------------------

There is a lot of source documentation available via doxygen, just type:

make docs

and it dumps it all out to docs/html. In particular, you will have a 
rapidly expanding todo list. If you want to contribute, that is a good
place to start. That and the Laxkit todo list.

A down and dirty way to become aquainted with the source code is to 
download the Laxkit to the top laidout directory (if it is not there
already), and change the following lines in the Doxyfile-with-laxkit
to say YES rather than NO:

SOURCE_BROWSER         = YES
EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

Then from the docs directory, run 'doxygen Doxyfile-with-laxkit', which
will generate a clickable source tree accessible from your favorite web 
browser.


Compiling on Mac OS X
--------- -- --- ----
For the adventurous, you can help make Laidout work on OS X.
Straight from downloading, it will not compile all the way on OS X.
You'll still need x11, Imlib2, freetype2, fontconfig, and cups.
I'm just guessing, since I don't have access to an OS X or other BSD
based machine, but it shouldn't be too hard to make Laidout work on them.
There are a few places where I use GNU-only functions, like getline(),
which shouldn't be very difficult to replace or define similar functions.
