WHAT IT CAN DO RIGHT NOW
------------------------
Laidout is currently in the 'Kind of a hack, but mostly works
on my machine' stage of development.

You can rearrange stuff on pages.. The fancy page spread editor
is sort of working, you can shift pages around pretty easily.
Many of the features are only partially implemented, and the
real meat of the program is only half in place right now.

You can export as Passepartout files, but only the images will
export. You can 'print' to a postscript file, but only images
and the upper corner of a bezier color patch gradient will print 
out, not the other gradients or paths.

Laidout and the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net) each share
some of the burden of the 'meat', but anyway...


COMPILING
---------

Ensure that you have the Laxkit (http://laxkit.sourceforge.net)
available. Laidout expects Imlib2 support to have been compiled
into the Laxkit. Then type:

make
make install

There is no 'configure' at the moment. 'make install' will put
laidout-(whatever version) in (usually) /usr/local/bin, and make a
symbolic link /usr/local/bin/laidout point to it.
The Makefile is for the development source, and also tries
to do 'make' of the Laxkit, since Laxkit and Laidout are 
so intertwined, so make sure that LAXDIR in the Makefile is
defined correctly. Just remove those parts of the Makefile
if you want to compile only Laidout.

After successfully making, the program 'laidout' in the src
directory is the thing you want. It can be run right where it's
at. 

Running the program will spit out copious amounts of debugging
info that there isn't a really good way to turn off at the 
moment, except to run like this:
./laidout > /dev/null


SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
--------------------

There is a lot of source documentation available via doxygen, just type:

make docs

and it dumps it all out to docs/html. In particular, you will have a 
rapidly expanding todo list.
