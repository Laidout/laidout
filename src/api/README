This directory is for functions and other items that are accessed through scripting,
or through callable actions.
Usually this means parsing the peculiar format of scripting parameters, and calling
some other function that does the actual work, usually located in a file or object in
some other directory.

Code for objects derived from DrawableObjects should go in ../dataobjects.
