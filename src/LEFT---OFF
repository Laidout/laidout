This file is for random notes and specific coding tasks that need to be done
to meet various goals. This includes Roadmap items as well as fixing bugs.
List bug tracker number if any.

When an item is satisfied, put it in the DONE section at bottom of file.
With each release, that section is transfered to the DONE file, and edited
down to major items in ../features.md.



--------------bugs: things that do not work like they are already allegedly designed to---------------------


------------ serious bugs to fix right now:

bug: Engraver fill, just moving mouse around is rerendering to buffer for preview

bug: severing clone link does some weird things, including crashing
bug: clone tool clones do not have proper bounding box

bug: curve is terrible approximation at end points

bug: back to not maximizing properly on default ubuntu. Seems to work fine on every other window manager I've tried.

bug: gegl nodes, connect sinus to waves and also to displace, freeze!


------------ other bugs:

bug: popup menus: submenus spawning on wrong side on far right monitors

bug: command prompt window cursor often invisible
bug: command prompt window input sometimes unrecoverably locks if cursor not at very end
DONE bug: command prompt window missing Laidout module

bug: lineedit cursor is leaving artifacts

Overwrite dialog box and other centering boxes should center over calling window, or current screen if no specified owner

drag off page, space to duplicate, copy is not in limbo!
duplicate does not duplicate clip_path

packaging woes: update deb/control to have more of the dependencies

booklet, use paper group tool, default paper group no longer displays

evince on ubuntu 14.04, pdf export won't load, says Syntax Error... Dictionary key must be a name object

configure should check for libreadline-dev? apparently not pkg-config ready <- half fix of listing in package requirements
  needs to use the new extra_cppflags thing

memory hole in ExportDialog.. open export, cycle through formats, quit
memory hole in reimpose .. reimposed 5 page booklet
memory hole when graphical shell activated
memory hole do laidout -n letter, split a window, then quit. undeleted Objects remain!
DONE memory hole, open up examples/nodes-asciichart.laidout, then quit. 1 object remains
DONE memory hole in calculator
DONE memory hole: start blank, exit. 3 remain!!
DONE memory hole helpwindow -> probably something to do with ShortcutWindow and ShortcutTreeSelector not refcounting as expected
DONE memory hole delaunayinterface
DONE memory hole objectfilters with interface
DONE memory hole ./laidout -n letter then quit
DONE memory hole paper interface, activate tool, lay down one paper, quit, 3 objects remain
DONE memory hole cairo backend (can't duplicate)

"edit imposition", then escape.. removes window, but not the frame!

lineinput not propagating escapable

clones of images scale not like images.. should also snap aspect to start of drag, not when control key pressed

select no doc, select doc, viewport jumps around... it should stay the same area
switch to None document, and units change to unreasonable

shearing or scaling produces null axes occasionally when crossing over opposite edge, borking the display
  --> seems to be only when needing to draw images on close to parallel axes, doesn't seem do it with paths

bug: page progress popup is wrong place, and mouse maps at wrong scale ONLY OCCASIONALLY, hard to reproduce

sometimes crash at insert page before (?? can't duplicate)

saving window positions doesn't take into account window decorations, makes pos slide downward each time
  _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS? _KDE_NET_WM_FRAME_STRUT? how to get before mapping a window?

scribus plugin: if directory of executable script is not writable, it fails!
 -> should find one that is writable
scribus plugin needs a proper dealing with temporary files

object reordering (with home/end) produces outline of unrelated objects on top

cloning, change original, not triggering bbox update in clone

ubuntu maximize window failing (but not on today's debian unstable gnome), resize seems to work now
gnome "application" does one per window, not one per app. this is not a bad thing imnsho, but should be easy to conform to desktop application spec properly
icon needs to be bigger.. is fuzzy on ubuntu alt-tab
DONE App/window icon in window manager not showing..

DONE??? need to implement scale pages to new imposition when reimposing (enable in doc settings dialog)

splitwindow SplitWindow:
create new pane should dup old pane.. currently divide viewport, removes document focus
viewwindow, change to spreadview, change back to view.. Horizontal ruler origin is REALLY off
splitwindow cursors existing in subwindows
create new window, defaults to no doc. should select doc of last pane
headwindow swapping is now REALLY messed up
pane swapping/dropto on maximized, swapping in general...

svg out, EquivalentObject doesn't play nice with defs.. only accessed once.. how to upkeep clones in this case?
    -> when equiv objects are composed of groups, what happens?
svg coord numpoints==0???? numpoints doesn't really serve any purpose other than debugging, but....
svg to coord incomplete: arcs needs testing
memory hole in svg in? test svg import, svg path import must be done
object deleting funky, import svg images, select one, hit delete, doesn't delete!!
svg not exporting images when they are children of other non-group objects

place 3 images, object select, must press delete twice...!?!?!?!

sigimp fail for multiple stacks with no folds!!

make sure all imposition types are available in interpreter

resource impositions not showing description when selected

fold indicator foldprogress just at crossover points incorrectly indicating affected folds


object tool shift-control for rotate does not allow positioning on drag bars

'g' for color sample changes cursor to cancel now, and changes on border cross!!!
Need better mouse shape support

possible modifier-pairing error with multiple mice...

file previewer not updating preview when using arrow keys

shrink image lets you go immeasurably small

stackframe seems to be ignoring window borders on layout

    bug: final letter in envelope size is wrong size
    vertical position bad
    horizontal spacing a bit wonky

  when baseline is from_path, should indicate path, not offsetted path

build: building: build process
  modernize debian/rules. See Laidout PR #5, https://github.com/Laidout/laxkit/pull/5
  should be able to specify include directories to configure, to work around hacky existence checks
  should be able to specify default icon size as a compile option
  should update faq with details about graphicsmagick, harfbuzz, and gegl versioning
  update configure message about try installing packages.. when fail on gegl, it's not listed
  should be able to do out-of-source builds
  make "make uninstall" work, and remove coop from installed position
  remove the lax onamac parts from configure? poorly named, more a bsd issue, not mac

  DONE make a laxkit.pc from laxkit configure
  use that laxkit.pc from Laidout and laxkit examples

  DONE fix hardcoded /usr/include/cups in laxkit/configure
  DONE laidout ./configure needs to pass on relevant things to laxkit
  DONE in config.log should show actual configure line for easy duplicating


export/print dialog
  what happens about background programs, like opening something in gimp? can't delete temporary files
  ---0.099---
  maybe flag whether to export limbo with spreads?
  need propper print dialog.. old ppd cups stuff is deprecated
  export should have a preview of what is actually going out, flip through spreads
  in papergroups with multiple papers and double sided impositions, need to ensure front and back are output properly for printer
  double check: export current appears to be broken
  needs to be ScrolledWindow
  should convert to use ValueWindow when it's ready

    DONE [] Send files to command: [ -Print commands- v]
  DONE load/save external tools config
  DONE debug validity check
  DONE after manage commands, list doesn't update from export dialog
  DONE bug: slider popup shouldn't show item if hide_from_Browse
  DONE make print button experimental only?  --> disable until a real print dialog happens

file filters: filefilters:
  multiple export targets, including per object export settings
  export with custom project files:
    like html gallery, has project config in coop/
    some files templated
    project defined by:
      directory with project files to copy
      export config to create files that go along with copied project files
      template vars to replace in set of copied project files

  config resource load/save
  need to ensure that when bouncing around filters, Export All sets range properly
  ---0.099:
  would be nice to standardize viewport render/obj-traverse so each exporter doesn't have to implement everything themselves
    like define an iterator to walk over the view
  fix when filtered object has children.. currently skips children
  need createImportConfig/createExportConfig to make ImportConfig/DocumentExportConfig objects from parameters for all filters....
  selecting out should auto select tofile | tofiles, depending on how many spreads selected for out
  export range should optionally allow label not spread indices? labels are only valid for pages.. by name "iii - iv", export preview better?
  perhaps switch export/import objects to new cascading Style as base..
  standardize basic load such that non-laidout files create new document of proper size then import
  todo: electric zine maker export/import?
  When there are errors or warnings in exporting, should be able to have the error log such that
    you can just jump to the offending bit easily. This would also be used for preflight verifiers,
    and maybe also mass edit things, like edit all images..
    - have ViewWindow::JumpToObject(&place, objectid);
  DONE need to preserve last settings per filter, remember full export settings
  DONE open with... on export ? combine with command option, which does basically the same thing.. need to decide about tmp files and unlink them

    DONE put command export within export_document()
pageatlas: page atlas:
  double check: export current not selecting the proper spread??

  export format should be an enum. need to extract possible save formats from Laxkit
  for gs, make sure temp file is removed, should probably locate in user space maybe? or make sure perms set reasonably
  DONE should have color select for background color, which would be alternate way to set full transparent
laidout export:
  ---0.099---
  need a Laidout out! for partial exports, or conversions between nets/papergroup lines/etc
  implement crop
  save option to force path data into svg d style instead of default laidout style
  save option to not output line caches

  bug: fonts are not doubled up, each text object is exporting its own

  ---0.099---
  export complex engraving is really, really slow. probably all the string reallocation?
  pdf optimize jpg dump, compress image data
  still true? pdf export if a path has null linestyle/fillstyle it buffers until next path drawn

  check for updates in file format for 1.5
  export color meshes, for recent versions of Scribus

  page clipping
  import/export color meshes, for recent versions of Scribus
  font size confusion
  import/export linear and radial gradients
  scribus in/out: font sizes, stroke widths
  import should try to apply the Scribus layout correctly, at least for 2 page spreads
  import should do something meaningful with original Scribus page bleed values
  scribus import: need to read page sizes from actual page attributes, as it may well be different than in document attributes
    -> this necessitates revamp of singles to use more than one paper type
  implement crop

  DONE obey object visible (no hidden objects natively)

ppt (passepartout): DEPRECATE
  implement crop
  implement paper rotation
ps: DEPRECATE
  implement paper rotation
  for plain postscript, there's bitmask, but no transparency. maybe optionally do simulation with dithered bitmask..
    a lot of work for a deprecated format, but could have other uses, like for PDF/X-1a
  paths not filling correctly
  engraver no out, equiv object problem?

  implement crop
  export seems to be rather broken
  command line export file name defaults to "output#.eps"
  implement paper rotation
xtg from quark?
idml from indesign?


freehand tool:
  should have option to output base weighted path, with custom filter resource to copy onto it
  keep a stack of lines previously made for fake undo by repeated delete? or just implement undo for object added
  path simplification needs to be considerably better, both points and weight nodes
  needs to account for time and speed
  auto apply line profile
  gradient select: custom or resource
  pressure curve
  mesh outputs should still be Mesh based on path
  implement Shape Brush?
    output to either "shape brush" line profile, or flattened path
  DONE numerical input for brush size
  DONE brush_size should be real, not screen units
  DONE need "brush size" controls
  DONE needs to respond to viewport color change

shape brush shapebrush:
  pathi -> save to shape brush should ask for a name

  DONE not saving to file

PathInterface: pathinterface
  bug: if path doesn't have linestyle in file, later crashes since it does not fill in
  bug: width handle has bit of a hitch when handle near a vertex.. extra temp width node being added?
  bug: seems to be possible to move nodes out of order, only occassionally
  bug: shift click down then up on a point selects then deselects.. control can toggle
  bug: problems for non-bez-controlled corners at endpoint. Also variable offset causes weird connections
  bug: applyoffset, the bez part at joins is messed up when no offset, suspect problem in FlatpointToCoordinate, mismatch with bez join next to sample points

  bug: should not create new control points by pressing cntl, unless there is movement
  bug: delete last weight node, sometimes width is wrong
  bug: make new line with freehand tool, cannot move weight nodes in a rational way

  drag on handle (not point) to resize handle. cntl to scale only it. cntl+shift to rotate it
  when you delete a point, curvertex should go to go to nearest previous
  need an easier way to edit gradient fills, like child tool edit for fill items, auto add filler types
  need simplify option on point delete to adjust control point lengths
  need option for bbox to include line width, not just centerline
  need stroke fill
  need path combine:
    with more than one object selected, turn to path tool, have a multi-object widget that lets you:
      Edit all objects at same time (default) -> box that says [3 objects] click for action menu?
      Combine to single object    (select from menu?)
      Combine and merge endpoints (select from menu?)
	  cross link linestyle or fillstyle

  DONE need numerical entry for all weight node characteristics
  DONE not show every single handle. only ones associated with active vertices

  that hot new spiro curve
  boolean ops
  mirror, array, with join (akin to blender modifiers)
  dup path object links the path style, but save and load, it is not linked... need to sort out line/fill style inheritance/linking
  needs input boxes for width nodes
  compound paths, change width only changes one. no way to affect all
  need a way to work on multiple weight nodes:
    shift all
    width multiply all
    set width
  need input boxes for weight node info
  zero tips not working on mesh edit? with import test-engrave.laidout
  debug cache sample point distribution, the interpolator is really bad as is
  powerstroke export requires apply offset.. else weight nodes are all messed up
  clarify export for weighted paths, use outlinecache and areacache as needed, check all filetypes exporters: svg pdf scribus image/ps/eps
  finish implementing joins. need to clarify weight behavior at corner joins
  weight computation is currently done based on even t spacing, but probably should be mapped based on distance
  interfs.cc: weights not being shown unless '_'
  be able to pull points back along path near endpoints

  debug extrapolate
  need to protect against reentrants at corner joins.. makes holes unless nonzero rule, and sometimes sticks out the other side
  sliding around the nodes is really annoying.. should do according to proximity to center line
  inkscape has multiple interpolators, we should too!
  actions to implement:
    need arbitrary cut
    need better apply offset: not simplifying offset path
    need path combine (combine path stacks of multiple PathsData)
    need break apart (make new PathsData from each in paths stack)
    need special break apart to make new PathsData, but preserve totally enclosed paths as intential holes
    need mechanism to be able to add custom path actions to context menu
  implement work on multiple path objects at once
  ApplyTransform() and MatchTransform() should adjust scaling of width nodes?
  custom caps.. define cap to a horizontal line, take endpoints and endpoint tangents, return the cap warped to fit the tangents
  custom dashes, with custom start/end dash caps
  so called vector brushes, that allow sweeping out an area with a whole shape
  need some kind of extrema fill in for angled paths, so it matches sweep of whole segment, not just endpoint sweep lines
  should have shortcut to offset ALL weight nodes, or angle ALL nodes
  how to deal with bbox when using wacky weights?? -> use bbox of outlinecache (or centercache), non-weighted (optional): use flat bbox + linewidth
  need something like path->PointInfo(t, &pp, &vprev_ret, &vnext_ret).. done is GetWeight(t, &width, &offset, &angle)
  maybe should revisit PathOperator stuff, such as for spiro paths
  per vertex join type?
  linestyles are always output independently, can't currently cascade with current code
  line join round should add extra point for really wide angles to make them more circular

  copy and paste
  maybe control when on vertex will create whichever handle does not exist, control nearest drag point determines which is created
  align nodes -> create temp set of data to pass to AlignInterface?
  transform handles for selected points, including flip
  subdivide, repeat key press restores old segment, then adds 1 more point to num of points from last press
  toggle between add points / select points?
  finish new path/pathoperator/pathsubinterface/pathinterface structure

  markers:
    resource drawables with extra "origin" and "direction", maybe stored as properties?
    they need to respond to object color.. marker is a SomeDataRef with filter to respond to obj.marker_color ?
    start, end
    mid
      at specific intervals, or n per line

simplepathinterface:
  make circle green when manual, gray when auto
  snap:
    toggle auto snap (control will reverse)
    auto snap to h and v when holding down control
  debug first point corner issue

engraving tool: Engraving  engraver
  bug: trace object opacity is not working for non-image trace objects.. stroke and fill needs mask integration!!
  bug: 'z' zaps mesh, but does not change cache border or point mapping

  cairo render NEEDS VAST IMPROVEMENT.. the clunky xlib approximation was fast, but not transferrable to cairo

  multiobject:
    object lines in group list needs eye per object, affect actual object visibility
    need to enforce resource unique names
    need ability to store overall styles of a patch, not just each individually
    on resource menus, should check mark if current matches a resource??

  orient:
    should adjust all linked
    with test-engrave-trace2.laidout, do the quick adjust, does not preserve width the first time, using old value of thickness?
    option to remember old values while adjusting position, rotation, spacing
     -> when manual tweaking of spacing, need to produce value reference so that future line orienting preserves line thicknesses

  tracing:
    seems to be grabbing spurious tracing values outside of the tracing object, and at borders of trace object
    tracing object, lines abort just inside the image, maybe should just go one off the edge?
    trace object needs flip, at least h and v, not really needing the whole affine thing
    need option to export trace object in same position as the traced lines, so it can be further processed elsewhere
    custom sample of channels
    sharp edge detection in tracing
    snapshot should be for all in selection
    shift-drag (or drag anything not covered by trace object) should drag ANY of the meshes in selection, not just current
    when multi objects, the traceobject is interweaved, based on draw order, only under current object, should be under all?
    make gradient interface work in trace mode

  freehand/path:
    freehand not being interpreted correctly: non-equal smooth is adding erroneous extra mesh column
    drawing custom freehand (with width) lines within the mesh area

  mesh path:
    'a' not selecting all in line

  curvemap needs predefined ramp profiles, remember last, load/save (per context?)
    -> options to insert various predefined patterns
    need magnify do dads for easy expanding of countour without having to place each and every node

  direction:
    need accuracy modifiers for dragging controls around
    only when at endpoints, lineprofile not producing smooth results at random spots inside
    should be able to adjust number of sample points to match up well enough for points in lineprofile
    random end point sliders should inc or dec according to which side mouse clicked down on compared to absolute end point
    spiral spacing computation bad when spokes are nearer radial
    save the opensimplex line displacement from line/point randomness, to be used to also adjust a spacing map to preserve value when viewed at a distance
    be able to trigger a reline on load in
    be able to set a 3-d parameter for noise? useful for animated noise
    option for "adjust for spacing", making weight reflect the spacing, either for constant width or trace
    line profiles: (done) linear, circular, radial, spiral?
    be able to edit and create new profiles
    grow
    spiral arm count makes poor resolution
    line generation:
      grow: implement custom line merge and break to preserve spacing across mesh contraction
      grow: edge abutment when generating
      sample point generation should be based on lines per mesh square, not total mesh field
      finish implementing spacing section -> spacing map

  add special group: half offset, perpendicular
  need stroke+fill options?
  need convert to path object ability
  current blockout is not very precise, needs approximation between existing point samples
  fully implement resolution adjustments for auto lines -> needs resolution tool
  single group (not group list) view is too old, doesn't do link circle, and can only select from current object groups.. remove it entirely?
  export doesn't work for: nothing for scribus, eps, ps
  edit brush ramp as symmetric ramp
  resolution tool: click to add between points within brush, control to destroy points in brush
  need merge group

  screen view, need option for Fast|Accurate
  no writability check on exportsnapshot
  allow temp override of linked to adjust only current?
  establish path needs better smoothness assignments
  keys being caught in patch, not in child path
  test: bez cache needs updating when points are moved around
  test: dash cache needs updating when points are moved OR thickness changed
  always brings current object to front (normal refresh in place, and then interface draw on top).. should be very optional, as it blocks out white overlays
  don't warp, move points, then warp, almost always has bad points: PatchData::getPointReverse() is too inaccurate
  undo/redo
  finish implement making the circle lines be closed circles
  need some kind of smooth out: smooth out width, and smooth out path
  hover over mode icons should show text of what you are hovering over (verbose mode?).. hard to remember, annoying to look at status bar otherwise
  should be able to draw a line and have that be a baseline for dash division
  option: either drop out of bounds points, or zap mesh to point bounds
  numsliders should have click on arrows for single increase, and a dismiss x for input box
  should probably abstract control panel creation so we don't have to hardcode everything all the time
  sampling could be more sophisticated, currently just grabs pixels, could downsample the image based on current spacing
  Danger! coons patch produces discontinuous contours within multiblock meshes!! who knew!?
  perhaps allow path objects to be adjusted with engrave tool for custom outlier lines not part of mesh?
  must implement mode based shortcuts in Laxkit. currently all mesh shortcuts are active
  stippling/decal mode, each sample is either a point, or map on an arbitary object, or sampled object?
    per stipple, adjust rotation, scale, color, morph

    linked vs appended node groups, to allow mass changing of particular effects
      GroupRef : NodeGroup, with some sort of relay to actual group internals
    node libraries: nodes as resources
      need to check for cyclic dependency in resources (and disallow)
  auto shift placement on connection
  auto connect when dragging nodes.. needs parsing of compatible properties
  view area things:
    node magnifier for easier browsing when otherwise zoomed way out
    toggle show only selected nodes?
  exec paths
    events for ui tool construction?
    exec tick speed control for debugging
  make sure entire nodes don't go totally offscreen
  deferred update when massive operations, maybe highlight nodes in yellow?
  color code pipes by value type, color: yellow, number: gray, vector: purple
  need better styling.. too much is hardcoded. problems later with high dpi screens
  finish implementing no cycle check: on load in could be a crash magnet currently if constructed with loops

    mechanism for plugin config files
    plugins maybe have plugin.conf resources/
  beef up the config window, to allow toggling plugins.
  figure out proper de-loading.. have to restart?
  check for already loaded
  think through plugin infrastructure better, and from external perspective
    need to beef out the plugin readme
    usually, a plugin dev downloads an sdk that might just have selected headers, and .so file
    how to specify plugin is built at all
    how to specify plugin is compiled in, or exists as .so

captioninterface CaptionInterface captiondata CaptionData
  default text size is super small
  bug: bitstream vera sans, "Text" convert to path puts e correct, but screen render puts it out too far. huh??
  ---0.099---
  should be able access fonts as resources, to preserve links on load/save
  implement proper pdf export
  color fonts: consider native otf:
    Mozilla and Adobe’s svg table, microsoft's colr/cpal, Google’s PNG images (CBDT/CBLC tables), Apple’s PNG images (SBIX table)
    freetype dev branch maybe supports colr/cpal and google's way?
  implement the different layout modes: rtl ttb
  debug for rtl and vertical as returned by hb, or set explicitly with direction
  right to left (figure out how to do with harfbuzz)
  need to do proper coordinate finding for mouseposition when paste into a nested group
  text to path:
    option to do all one path,
    or separate objects per character (or glyph), but clones of a resourced group of glyphs
  need handling when opening a file and the font is not found!!!!!!!  options for substitution
  opentype variations
  select, copy
  for overstretched alignment, bounding box not updating correctly
  should adapt from multiline edit, since it already has cut/paste, selections, and is mostly debugged??
  control-u hack for poweruser unicode character insertion

  use selected text as sample when popping up font dialog
  lorem ipsum
  markov ipsum
  DONE right click menu options for insert char and select font
  DONE bug: why is a font being created and destroyed each refresh??

DrawableObject:
  bbox and aabb need to build in kids?
  should transplant child to SomeData? would simplify making new objects considerably. or do (parenting shell)-data like blender
  DONE SomeData should derive from DumpUtility

fontdialog: FontDialog
  bug: makeinwindow SOMETIMES not working, select one, puts on bottom line
  ---0.099---
  need a way to remember layered fonts, to easily activate and deactivate
    read from standard fonts places, like .config/laidout/(version)/fonts
  favorites: tag and column
  user tags, not just fontmatrix tags, option to update fontmatrix?
  should be able to access list of font favorites, and a user's preferred organization of fonts..
  need to implement load specific file for a font

  font->SetFromFile() should do more fontconfig checking to grab propper file+family+style+size
  FindFont() is faulty, as it only lookes up family/style.. should search by the unique file name
  sometimes family+style is not unique, but has different languages.. should detect this
    use postscriptname: "DroidSansHebrew-Bold" -->  "Droid Sans Hebrew"/"Bold"

  bookman font style names getting chopped off: due to name collision and using psname as reported by fontconfig
    this is unreliable! need to have proper unique font naming
  sample block should be multiline
  need support for svg fonts.. useful for pure svg fonts, and opentype svg, see cairo user fonts
  pgup and down doesn't select a reasonable one
  fontconfig directory config options
  should REALLY have a LayerFont head containing the whole list, not a stand alone list which causes too many problems
  figure out why some color fonts are not scanned by fontconfig
  needs line spacing slider
  option to search by spacing, ie monospace, see fontconfig: FC_PROPORTIONAL, FC_DUAL, FC_MONO, FC_CHARCELL

ellipseinterface:
  need rotate handles
  select object, but controls not visible.. not passing current seleceted?
  del on center cross hair should straighten?
  incorporate as special mode in path tool
  angle drag lapping should preserve large arc
  if you click and release without dragging, should not make a really tiny new data, should keep old if any

  DONE center cross hair should be slanted when shape is slanted
  DONE incorporate to mesh tool
  DONE derive from Value in LEllipseData, needed to make object property i/o work correctly
  DONE bug: inner radius hint not using center
  DONE memory hole
  DONE implement minimal fill:color, stroke:color+width
  DONE should have menu options for wedge and toggle circle
  DONE debug wedge hover
  DONE draw dotted for wedge edge?
  DONE click or drag to/away from origin  on open arc edge to toggle wedge, open, chord
  DONE render with inner bad since drawfocusellipse ignores inner
  DONE drag radii, toggle control, original center point should also be remembered
  DONE angles mess up when foci flip
  DONE snap angles with control
  DONE control drag on x or y should move center, keep opposite
  DONE inner radius
  DONE snap closed if drag start to end near enough (multiple of 2*pi)
  DONE outer, inner, center hover need indicators
  DONE need numerical entry
  DONE implement angles.. bug with bez_ellipse, not spanning start to end properly
  DONE shift, control down up to toggle hover 
  DONE Remove old rect interface stuff, debug basic render and new object creation

Clean up patch/mesh controls: Mesh PatchInterface
  bug: convert path to mesh inserting null patches at each point
  bug: rotate/scale single or more control points should move attached controls in smooth mode

  circle warp:
    DONE bug: circle: non-circle breaks ellipse scan
    DONE bug: circle: drag center, breaks ellipse scan
    DONE bug: sets "circle" property, but does not output the data to file
    DONE bug: render initially displaying in small rect. changing inner radius gets it to sync

  ---0.099---
  bug: base on path remove/add should try to remember previous weight nodes, scratch only when mod points (not colors) too far off
  bug: should still be able to edit colors while based on path
  need ability to rect select points, like for cone gradient, points on overlapping edge can't be selected
  no ellipse right click options

  DONE bug: select whole edge fails when points overlap and select near active
  DONE when color points overlap like with circle warp, have a way to change all coincident color points -> workaround: auto_select_close
  DONE selected nodes should probably be more prominent and colored, just gray disappears, hard to work with
  DONE bug: can't change point types with menu... path is not getting any menu messages
  DONE maybe should not be able to escape off path tool when editing as path, since that breaks path connection
  DONE bug: when edit as path, path is below the mesh, so can't see path
  DONE bug: subdividing is broken beyond 1st subdivide on anything other than outer patches
  DONE bug: selected points, hover over edge, try to drag deselects then moves whole mesh. Should select for hovered and move that
  DONE bug: when on edge, it highlights, but if you are outside of mesh, it will switch to other object
  DONE bug: smooth edit fails along edges
  DONE add new patches should smoothify joins when in smooth edit
  DONE smooth edit not working when more than one square
  DONE just as moving edges, should be able to move any vert column or horizontal row of points
  DONE implement more right button config options to make the settings more discoverable
  DONE smooth edit mode should be default. 

0.099: ImagePatch:
  abstract to be a filter, with optional stand alone object

0.099: ColorPatch / MeshGradient:
  need bicubic color interpolation, as just cairo bilinear is pretty ugly
  need sampling from beneath
  convert from/to linear/radial gradient as possible
  DONE flip colors vertically or horizontally

0.099: PatchData:
  smooth edit needs to adjust for interior point smoothness
  reverse lookup is not very precise: need to warp back and forth ONLY when necessary, as when
    switching to different, non-point-distort mode
  perspective arrangement: approximate transform controls through perspective grid
  maybe have status message say how many points are selected
  need bez path to mesh, and extract bez from mesh
  krita mesh tool has "uv preserving" move edge, yowza!

  edit multi objects in mesh tool.. should be able to move around many nodes?
  rect select nodes
  coons are not really smooth at internal edges? try with engraver, makes corners with current inner interpolation
  tracing infrastructure should be part of base mesh class.. would make easy for color mesh to use

  nudge mode with shift + arrow keys?
  See that lgm talk about "local mod" to do subdivided mesh modifications that reduces control point clutter
  make base path dump_out as Path, not PathsData? make it easier to read file removing the unnecessary??

GroupInterface groupinterface ObjectInterface objectinterface: group: object interface object tool
  select/unselect all
  new drag/scale/rotate behavior:
    anchor point drag should use the new widgets as appropriate
    DONE rotation circle, inner: number +-/absolute,  mid: free rotate,  outer: snap rotate
    DONE scale slide bar, go above or below, allow number input
    DONE drag with shift lock to nearest drag axis
  constrain aspect for corner scale handles should do so from drag start, not moment of mod press
  control-move flip line to snap to horizontal, vertical, 45 deg, or common gravity points
  maybe show flip and 90 deg rotate handles only when mouse outside the selection area?
  anchors:
    need to be able to control click outside box to create? currenty you must click inside, then drag it out
  world / local transforms:
    screen
    world
    object
    object parent
    object parent parent (etc)
  object select, 'a' toggle select or not, select all in current selection area (ie page or layer base)
  
  'm' should be able to move whole groups, means must be in object tool?
  
  For objects that appear very small, the drag handles should not be operable.. shift only
  For objects that are really skinny, it is not practical to have the handles be a percentage of the skinny
    part.. should have minimum drag areas?


  parent options colors don't really make sense
  real menuify the clone options
  need consistent system to coordinate selection changes between any tools or windows that need to be in sync
  viewport should fully utilize Selection::CurrentObject(), keep curobj in sync
  implement move to "Some other page..." when 'm' in groupinterface
  things to allow editing of wrap, inset, clip paths(done), and chains

  DONE hide/unhide
  DONE default hide draggable flip, but have as right click option
  DONE menuify parent options

Reparenting:
  the label hint should have "Parent: ItsId" and "Child:Id"
  need option to select parent from current selected, like Parent to > (list)

ObjectIndicator objectindicator:
  current should be bold
  clicking around in hierarchy should remember children we just clicked from
  need ability to click on object to select that object. Rename only when already selected
  allow drag reparenting
    hover over parents to pop list of alternate children to reparent to
  show (root) at bottom of stack

voronoi Voronoi delaunay Delaunay: point set pointset

    DONE custom radii
  need to be able to cache need to recalc shapes
  bug: coincident points cause weird problems
  be able to control inset shapes
  is double rendering when object is selected
  importing raw points or data without matrix should map so that it all appears on screen

    auto fill with randomized colors
    sample point color from background?
  merge different voronoi objects
  multiple point select
  separate selection to new object

overwrite:
  tab/left/right/enter not doing anything. should be able to control with keys

FileDialog filedialog:
  when on recent, going back should just revert to directory view
  click on big image/pdf, takes time to generate preview. click on already selected, regenerates preview
    need a click to generate preview, gen preview in background
  file dialog, single click should not enter directory, double click should do that
  bug: layer on a page won't allow collapse/expand
  bug: sort caseless, other sorts not working
  should be able to click on column header to sort
  focus should start on file line
  ^l should shift focus to file line
  when something is not openable or saveable, buttons should be greyed out
  file dialog needs click on parent dir to jump to the dir, but still be able to easily return to prev dir
  implement icon list selector
  Resizing zaps view to top, should preserve 1st in window
  need laidout only bookmarks file
  edits color style: bg alternating isn't highlighting
  tooltip to show full path of bookmarks
  need drag and drop bookmarking
  when you change directories, it should indicate if it corresponds to a bookmark

  DONE implement option for (or just show) directories first
  DONE bug: saving before asking for overwrite? ..no?
  DONE bug: overwrite not escapable?
  DONE enter on file line: if has dir, change dir, else trigger save
  DONE should probably have a scroll bar

dual monitors: multi monitor multimonitor
  centering windows should center on monitor of originating window
  open in same screen as mouse
  when you open a new window, ensure that it is always on screen
  DONE Menus should respect actual screen borders, not just full virtual screen

high dpi hidpi:
  uiscale option
    passing in 1 is different than having no uiscale, why??? forcing it to check screen??
	should have option to use native icons.. otherwise they render kind of bad.
      prefs.scale_icons ?
  DONE don't hardcode for instance thin as 1

    detect if scaled icons make fuzzy and ask to rebuild
	detect if missing icons, ask to build
  need in app themeeditor to easily adjust things that are off
  per monitor ui scaling:
    xrandr only gives monitor names like DP-5 DP-0
    xrandr --verbose lists EDID hex block that usually contains monitor model somehow
    auto scale by detected pixel density
  perhaps respond to GDK_SCALE or QT_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR (or maybe only QT_SCALE_FACTOR)
    update all widgets accordingly
    affected:
      font sizes
      window bevel, padding
      thin line in interfaces
      various interface threshholds, like path node indicator size, touch distance
  DONE supply a "default" ppi? for instance xlib thinks: 94.1467h or 94.0741v of multisync lcd2490wiki2 (specs say 94)

accessibility:
  allow changing theme from command line, config file, or settings window
  have alternatives whenever a tool expects modifiers + mouse movement
themes:
  option to use different go/don't go colors
  on ThemeUpdated events, things need to account for:
    color styling
    pads
    font size/type
    refreshing icons
  should be able to access theme files/directories, instead of define all in laidoutrc
  should be all cascading, bare minimum font size should be defaultable
      so like a common style is loaded FIRST, then particulars dumped in afterward:
        theme
          windowstyle common
            category common
              ...
  laxkit interface manager interfacemanager:
	  touch threshholds:
		near point: default 5 px ? try to find a real world measure based on monitors?
	  draw point sizes:
		normal bez point, for instance
		hovered size
	  DONE make DraggedThreshhold an InterfaceManager ui scalable setting
  DONE laxprofile not working

laxkit:
  save dialog should probably ignore clobber safety and allow enter key in edit to be "save". also auto focus file edit on start and on ^l
    if you enter a new location in file edit, first go to that place. else save with that file name
  FileDialog, when you instantiate with particular thing, it should be highlighted and shown in file pane
  need more mechanism so that popup dialogs stay on top of window they are "children" of
  need better indication of focused/not focused
  need to make sure the weird stuff with xim/xim_ic in anXApp::CreateXInputContext() still works after not creating new xim_ics
    need to investigate using ibus
  should revamp the viewport color events to exclusively use Color objects and handle specials
  lists need move semantics
  CheckDirs / check_dirs is confusing
  when resizing viewportwindow and a temp_input window active, make sure it stays on screen?
  instead of _LAX_PLATFORM_MAC, do relevant check with _LAX_ON_NON_GNU instead? currently only place this is necessary is where getline is used
  from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS especially when dialogs are up
      focus off a dialog, then refocus, must manually set control focus. should store which subwindow
       gets the focus when autofocused.
  having managers as singletons in Laidout seems to make crash on exit.. for some reason manager destructor order matters
  should take precautions so that dialogs do not get buried, would need to respond to circulate events
  in laxkit, key and mouse state should already be filtered to only contain laxkit modifiers,
  reserve names for CommandMask (macs), and a few other custom masks for other weird keyboards
  lineedit:
    seems to be an occasional redo bug, reinserting in wrong position
    password
    date
    time
    DONE dir
  for blend modes, maybe place name conversion in Displayer, in case there are a ton of custom blend modes??
  rowframe/squishybox would be nice to have aspect preserving squishes

  DONE interfs example has memory hole: interfaces are not being destroyed
    DONE shortcutmanager should be singleton
	DONE unitmanager should be singleton

  with text colors, mouse over highlight is off (can't dup?!?)
  not showing alternate gray/white bgs (can't dup?!?)
  option to use markup for labels

  dnd colors somehow? interpret text "#fff" as a color
  drag from lax edits to other places (in and outside app)

  implement proper action querying, like when you press shift, control for copy or replace while dragging.. is it necessary, we always copy?

  DONE Initiate dnd
    DONE set up system dnd state
    DONE send regular updates per protocol
    DONE send data per protocol on drop if to other process, or internally if drop on ourself
  DONE accept dnd

align tool: aligninterface AlignInterface align:
  needs polishing, the lines and indicators get a bit lost
  context menu seems to be the group interface menu
  need way to specify center of rotation per object
  need to make discoverable, not just as key shortcuts
    -> make as standalone tools, now that viewport stores selection?
  endpoints should be oriented triangle, not circles which make it look like path nodes
  explode in normal align
  should be able to scale and rotate a non-line path when not in path mode
  need manual mode.. drag grid marks to position manually... have that option available on others, auto transform to auto
  gap looks ugly.. have indicator highlight path itself, drag that around
  would be VERY handy to be able to recall previous arrangements, so you can partially redo
  final layout options: unoverlap -> possibly snap to path, then spread out on path to not overlap
  extra custom finishing per object?
  reorder on layouts? -> how to handle reorder in gap and unoverlap?
    trace out order path... show with numbers
  drag out path, order of intersection is new object order?
  maybe grid drag control to reorder
  snapping:
    snap to page middle, left, right, top, bottom
    snap to original selection bounds
    snap to first bounds
    snap to last bounds
    snapping to 0/50/100
  number box while dragging, goes away after a second, or click on it to edit
    if inc/dec arrows, have it inc or dec the decimal place cursor is on
  default presets: inkscape crossover

empties:
  need display object to make visible if truly empty.. display object is not exported
  DONE need node just for empty.. remembering NewObject->Group is irritating
  DONE use as targets in, for instance, node alignments

need infrastructure to propagate and save tool settings
Tools should remember their settings
    remember tool settings: double click on tool icon? right click...
    remember tool settings

    figure out which settings need to be remembered, and install as resource.. what happens when diff
     windows are using diff tools? which settings are remembered? have tool styles that are saved, as
     well as the running tool use settings

paperinterface: papergroupinterface papergroup interface
  when reset scale or rotation, preserve relative orientations

  fancier path selector
  for preview field, show green or something and change tooltip if preview will get generated

  importimages-> eps --> they are fit into boxes!! they should maybe be inserted into a stream..
  importimages: remember last settings
  DumpImages within Arrangements? a template of rect regions (2-d guides)?  maybe use custom papergroups?
    would also implement the dump into Limbo
    dump into any chain of objects, this is really the same thing as laying out a stream, maybe merge this?
  a "Place" tool like indesign?? preview images and place by dragging out one by one, as well as optionally into Arrangements

  DONE need drag and drop from system for multi-image import

external tools: external commands:

  DONE figure out a way to standardize verifying that tool exists: command name: search in $PATH, check if executable

shortcut dialog: shortcuts: shortcut manager shortcutmanager
  bug: ObjectInterface Duplicate objects has key u0000 ???
  bug: on pulling up window, action list shows current tool, but that is not highlighted in area list
  bug: keyboard display stretched way too much, general window arrangement is really bad
  bug: sort by columns is not sorting by anything rational
  saving keys for first time should default to config directory
  need to be able to delete keys
  layout needs to save
  need mode column, mode based shortcuts have no display capability
  area heads need to have human titles, _("Image Tool") instead of "ImageInterface"
  mode for shortcut check not quite working, such as ' ' with button to duplicate

signature editor  Signature editor Signature Editor signatureeditor
  bug: edit imp from viewport, change page number, should it insert pages??
  bug: background colors are wrong now.. supposed to be gray background
  mouse roll on paper size is confusing
  number input for everything
  symmetric trim
  be able to enter final size, and adjust trim to match
  should be able to drag and drop stacks
  making new paper size should try to find matching paper name for a given size
  fold replay should start showing FRONT page of stack, not back. THIS IS A BUG
    if start from whichever, should show inverse of folds to normal as necessary
  scale pages preview needs to use margin area, not page area
  needs indicator of number of groups, show 3/10 for current sheet in little box above stack, allow numerical input

  show margin, trim, binding when not totally folded
  for large page counts, need number entry in stacks
  would be nice to indicate when there is a centerfold of any signature
  mixing different page sizes mixes up the PageLayout at boundaries. alignment should be either always centered, or custom
  after you add stack, the added one should be selected
  must implement dragging around instance blocks...
  helper controls to adjust inset to match up final size for sigs of different size
  indicators for different signature instances when viewing page spreads
  need to be able to designate particular sheets with properties (like color),
    as current insert mechanism assumes folds happen before insert
  tab to cycle through handles for numerical input
  mouse over and drag show numbers on canvas
  export pdf or lo doc template
  implement work and turn, work and tumble interface
  should probably be some kind of tooltip to say shift for fold under.
  binding edge must be same orientation for all stacks and inserts
  need a paper size editor stand alone window, entering numbers should convert name to custom
  paper select should give hints as to whether paper size can hold actual final size
  detect non staplable binding edge, show red rather than green
  test impose-only for all imposition types
  be able to specify single sided.. allows bound accordian foldings?
  implement creep

global Laidout settings:
  settings dialog
    rearrange dir lists
	rebuild icons
	set uiscale live
	resource search directories, per resource
	remove old palette_dir thing, it should be wrapped into resources
	need "import settings from..." (but always use hardcoded laidoutrc)
  color theme
  icons
  tooltips
  per tool default settings
  thin line width (default 1 pixel, but this is bad for high dpi screens)


---------------- 0.099 ROADMAP ITEMS: features and enhancements ------------------------

Gradients: gradientinterface
  ---0.99:
  constrain to x/y/45 dragging end points
  dragging around color points from inside to outside should allow going out of bounds
    DONE linear
    radial
  perhaps split radial and linear gradients to different tools? makes more sense
  tool: drag define gradients ala substance
  tool: sketch define gradient fields ala sketch studio

  do dithering to reduce banding
  color interpolation: render to image, then use that as color source
    linear (current default and only option)
	constant
	auto bez
	curve editor rgba

  gradient data should be able to use resource GradientStrip
    owner: file/user global/system global
    name
    tags
    color strip:
      stops
        position
        r1, r2

pagemarkerinterface:
  option to lock label size to real space? make export contact sheets a little prettier in some cases
  right click option to turn off? sometimes it overrides other interface clicks, mouseovers are confusing

page thumbnail should be rational, ie image should be whole page, not just contents+transform,
     and thumb transform makes image dims to page coords

global resources:
  build use case of setting a global var for current language, then have objects update according to it

need a Revert option

Reconfigure text edits. Need something that works in interface land, with harfbuzz, that integrates with lax fontmanager

lgm 2019 feedback and ideas:
  path tool:
    hard to see helper graphics, needs haloing
    press space to dup weight node while dragging
  method to fix all broken images at once
    mass image edit, need to remap dirs for old files!!
    option: do just this one, or fix all
    old path: _____     new path: _____
  method to collect all used resources of a doc for distribution
  be able to load old docs
  from here on out, ensure backwards compatibility of files still works
    enhance mystery data to work with laidout data too?
  some kind of graphicsmagick LoadToMemory bug.. could be only on loading old file, bad config translation?
  out clicking from a dialog should probably destroy that dialog.. too easy to get buried confusedly in windows
  make connecting to online information easy: click to open web browser, xdg-open?
  from talk: diffusion curves, "local mod" mesh manipulation

ViewWindow:
  maybe drawaxes should show dotted line from origin to bbox?

Palettes:
  load palette should have a preview: file dialog preview function
  allow editing palette strips, import those to gradient tools
  custom palettes
  if height < 2*textheight, then hide name info
  wheel between loaded palettes?
  have a none color
  right click for:
    load palette
    select palette
    save palette
    dup palette
    New from a generator (like rainbow)
Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window
    -->delay until proper color implementation in place

WATCH OUT for when preview file is OLDER than original file!!

panel editing:
  selecting objects really sucks
  data-data-
  bulk assign meta
  meta edit:
    should allow both name+value for new
  parenting and unparenting really sucks
    options should be:
      Jump to parent --hover to show what is the parent
      Unparent
      Parent under first --hover to show potential parent
      Parent under last --hover to show potential parent

need something like laximages->Save(file, format, native_save_only), in case object doesn't know how to save to that format.. maybe default to something like static ImageLoader::Save

need ability to show "reprocessing.." or "progress.." indicator in different thread to what is actually processing
  must multithread long operations

object content selector menu to more easily flip between tools for object-content-streams-otherSpecials

need a better file preview system
  need to wrap laidout_preview_maker(), which previews EPS with the help of gs

createlaidoutrc() should migrate to a LaidoutPrefs::CreateLaidoutrc(), not a direct LaidoutApp func

remove imlib/"xlib" font, image, and render backends, replace with GraphicsMagick and cairo, keep imlib loader but load to cairo image only
  remove displayer-xlib
  remove fontmanager-xlib

image loaders:
  implement loader priorities
  some way to prioritize image saving

rework ui to be programmable. Perhaps an ui builder

LaxCairoImage:
  make sure image counters are ok, such as in new Crop()

gif flipbooks:
  mod to center trims in sig editor
  need a revert to last save option
  for one offs, need to implement progressive repeat imposing
  auto format partition so final page size has same aspect as image
  sig editor needs number input
gif exporter:
  use graphicsmagick? C example: http://www.graphicsmagick.org/api/api.html
  set custom timing in page properties

text (see also src/text/text.txt):
  need options per font on export to: convert to path, subset, embed
  need standard way to have default font, apart from defaultlaxfont, as well as default color/other visual attributes
  global font list, finish implementing uniquinizing font names, need final step of some kind of file name diff
  freetype/fribidi/harfbuzz all over everything?
  interface base for utf8 based editing.. share this with window edits somehow
  maybe fonts should point to their creators to make duplication more reliable if there are more than just default fontmanager
  need support for font substitution
  harfbuzz support
  math mode
  track bookmarks
  inline graphics
  css import/export
  tabs on arbitrary paths
  google font import

common property editor tool:  ..overlay and put editor box in a corner?
  - select a bunch of objects
  - tool determines properties in common:
      name + type
      whether properties are equal
        if not equal provide menu to select from existing to apply to all
  - Provides widgets to change those properties all at once

  maybe other mode, where you can copy certain properties, then apply those to other objects?

large files:
  note that most object dump_out routines now use Attribute intermediary rather that write directly to file.
    if this becomes a problem with large files, need to revert that, or update so less heap thrashing
  page range file refs, so you can make massive docs without the whole thing in memory at once?

Whenever there's a byte read in, like with read_in_whole_file to string, really should do some minimal string validation before using it?

resource manager needs to store unknown objects as Attribute trees, so they can still be preserved
  for future processing. for instance, be able to recover from when a plugin is missing

need to implement DRAW_Hires for all interfaces that default to preview renders. needed for proper image out
  includes at least image(done), path, engraver

mousemove decorations shouldn't change when an interface absorbs one

dataobjects/datafactory should somehow combine with stylemanager.. seems redundant as is
 
raster paint layers, mypaint?

newdoc:
  open on image should create a new singles with default paper and image centered

Units:
  page units should be adjustible so that node enthusiasts don't have to use inches.. maybe make page layer transforms scale by a units conversion
  need something like Convert(value, units_from, units_to, &error, overrides), where overrides is
    something like: list of [units_id, newscaling], like for temp redefining "Em" or "px"

selecting in viewwindow
  on limbo, and spread/page, papergroup, select  first object it finds
  else
    if curobj, select only siblings of currently selected
    if no curobj, select only children of current context
  if you click on something, then single click again, search for anything else under
  double click group to descend into group
  double click or enter non-group to edit content
  cntl-double click or cntl-enter to descend into non-groups' kids
  currently on selected object, click not on handles:
    C left click drag: scale around mouse
    S+C Left drag: rotate
    Left drag: move object

    C left click: place/remove anchor points

Nudge tool nudgeinterface nudge interface:
  break off from engraver tool, to operate on any PointCollection

build net interface graph

autosave
  start fresh doc, autosaves which may be saving into confusing location. maybe save in config dir?
  autorecover.. -> when an autosave is newer than the file we are opening
  option to choose how many to save near original file, and how to remove old
    [ ] Backup on save to: __%f~__   ___%f#~___ <-- use '#' to signal increment save
            %f=filename, %b=basename (without extension), %e=extension, # for numbered autosave
    [ ] Autosave.
      Time between autosaves:___5_minute__  ...ms millisecond s sec seconds second m minute min hr hour h
      Naming for autosaves: __%f-autosave#____
      Number of different autosaves: ___1___

need option for always write relative links.. now defaults to absolute

file button expansion:
   Collect...          <- gather all refd files into one place. ask to specifically not collect per file
   ----
   Commit (git)        <- ensure file is git tracked.. add if necssary before commit
                             double check that other files refd by this one are tracked in same repo as well?
                          maintain list of what to collect, what to ignore when committing?
   Commit settings...  <- choose or set up repository, how to handle passwords?? libgit?
   Revert...           <- show log, select old

open from template:
  needs to be incorporated in newdoc dialog
  get template list:
    scan all template dirs: ~/.config/laidout/version/templates, or SHAREDIR/templates
    name -- file path -- basic info about file

really thin objects should still be selectable, need to add a slight grab area outside bounding box
should be able to click within selection box to move all and not click right down on one of them

need to implement image cache clearing on low memory, to substitute for cairo not doing it like imlib did

minimum dp size is not small enough

anInterface::PreRefresh(), for instance to get engraver trace object to render below all selected objects

need to clarify what happens when you open and close documents.
  open and close docs always leaves limbos behind
  open already open pops new window
  not sure if it should also record ownership of limbos
    open doc:  limbo->SetResourceOwner(document);
    close doc: if (limbo->ObjectOwner() == doc) limbo->SetResourceOwner(nullptr);

colorbox color box:
  hsv slide, configurable clicks

color slider popup: colorpicker color picker colorsliders
  optionally show numbers, click to edit
  color strips for full transparent should show checkers in all strips, not just the alpha strip
  have a "Done"/"Dismiss" button
  be able to choose which color sets are visible
  make color slider box be able to be a pane
  need palette selection tab
  click without dragging select color
  click and drag shifts, but DOES not set value under mouse
  out click on hex edit is picking color
  clicking anywher in the new/old should swap
  show numbers to click on: 255, 65535, float
  toggle sets of sliders: rgb, cmyk, alpha, cielab, hsl
  DONE bug: text is not showing at correct size at first

Colors:
  color picker that previews text?
  convert to using Color objects instead of all ScreenColor:
    gradient
    color patch gradient
    image patch
    caption
    linestyle
    fillstyle
    path
    DONE images (doesn't use color per se)

need a global Laidout method of making unique ids
 -> update in Engraver tool, and object indicator overlay

plugin for easy antiprism import for net creation

for purely command line execution, should be able to make a binary totally not X dependent.

externally saved pages, for long documents
  save "page" files? reference from Document?
  and/or save "object" files, with layers in the file, have special DrawableObject flag to save its contents externally

conformal mapping option instead of mesh? see http://benpaulthurstonblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/parameterized-quadratic-conformal.html

command prompt window: command line
  bug: delete at pos 1 deletes space after prompt, then does not allow any input
  option to record/save/load whole session of prompt window
  up/down should traverse history
  control-up/down, break out so you can go anywhere

load document, should load images on display only(done), or create previews in background..

guides:
  snap guides to objects
  snap objects edges to various things
  straigt lines at any angle
  grids
  polar grids

Spread Editor:
  need to make pagelocation ref count pages, or (need to anyway) check all known views for errant page refs after delete pages
  would be nice if apply and reset should be grayed as relevant
  adjust page preview resolution
  after an insert, have temp wheelable number indicator, update on screen?
  need to be able to move empty spreads
  need to remove hidden pages from pagemarker
  debug select spreads with rectangle -> need real box intersect? do we?
  modify page range gui, click on a page label, where ever it might be... select pages in spread editor
  debug spread limbo threads and page groups
    implement render
    debug drag and drop
  create new document from spread view?
  hide should collapse into a single thing so you can arrange more simply, instead of still having to sift through many

animated beacons for anchor points to make them visible

curves:
  curvemap needs predefined ramp profiles, remember last, load/save
  curvemap needs brush ramp mode to show symmetric graph
  clip wrap render to graph rect
  brush ramp edit mode: incompatible with wrap? or just have editor move points symmetrically?

Convert impose-only to be based on feeding it an ExportConfig

clarify how locks, visible, selectable works. base in Laxkit?

overlays should get first pick of input, BUT if another has a button lock, it shouldn't mouse move update

standardize new Impositions: convert to new ResourceManager system. each has:
   interface OR window editor
   class type
   default resources
  possible to define other editors for any imposition type

option to select region by intersect, not by corner inclusion...

When importing from an image list file, should be able to say if and when to auto-make previews
    new option in file, should be easy

mystery data enhancement: import as placeholder objects: if convertible to laidout elements, do not actually
                expose them as such. Keep source in external location, current laidout only rearranges.
                  ---> this is same as import as image, but using laidout objects to render them with, not bitmap images
                  ---> this is useful to have a standard object indicator built from laidout objects, but
                         do not let them be editable
when importing, have MysteryData, which has special attributes "@file-pos" which says
 where in the original file the attribute starts:
 MysteryData
   transform/bounds
   title (shown in screen)
   description
   file format the data is from
   attribute style listing of the object? or straight from file
 in: convert file to attributes, or provide method to tailor to an output format (eps, pdf objs, raster image),
         and provide a preview image or object to stand in for the file..

viewport:
  allow multiple, positionable spread views visible on same viewport

resources:
  should have a way to narrow down what resources are saved when you save a single document.. right now, if you
    have multiple docs open, the resources are mixed
  really should have option to separate or merge resources when multiple documents open, rather than always merge?
  textobjects,limbos,papergroups should maybe be able to be stored per document, not just file, project, or temp
    either that, or do away with whole project/document difference, and use only
    projects with their own directory, and documents without their own directory
  should be resources:
    Palette
    Linestyle
    Fillstyle
    PaperGroups
    PaperStyle
    DONE PlainTextObject

when closing a document window, decide whether this removes access to it, or just the view to it

how best to integrate Styles, Attributes, and Values???
various object types:
 Laidout
 Project
 Document
 Page
 Group
  draw objects: Image, ImagePatch, Paths, Path, LinearGradient, RadialGradient, PatchGradient
 PaperGroup
 PaperType
 Imposition: Singles, DSS, Booklet, Signature, Net:Box, Dod, etc...
 ImageImportFilter
 ImportFilter:svg,ppt,sla,ps,eps,odraw
 ExportFilter
-->Styles are Values that can be cascaded from other Styles
   Values by themselves cannot be cascaded
-->C++ classes represent data that can be accessed and modified through:
     onscreen:           compels direct c++ access
     file saved to disk: uses Laxkit::Attribute as intermediary for disk i/o
     interpreter:        parses input using Value objects which have ObjectDefs defined at runtime
   would be advantageous to write a single object def, and output options and documention to each of the 3 targets
 each class:Value potentially has:
  - "internal" variables/funcs that don't correspond to ObjectDef entries which are all "public"
  - scriptable variables/funcs defined in ObjectDef
  these are vaguely compatible, but it is not a 1 to 1 match
     some kind of preprocessor (ugg!!) to convert the header file to object def

pointin should check to visual boundary, not bounding box (? maybe just optionally)

customizable object child relationships to parent, rather than simple transform
  this needs to be reworked to be an object filter instead of special anchor properties

  incorporate gss? https://gss.github.io/
  DONE scale x
  scale y
  scale free
  stretch, proxy displays ok, but after install stretch doesn't work
  shear *** seems to be off from point, need shear protection, produces null axes sometimes
  DONE scale

  add parent target anchor
  add object anchor
  margin area not working
  implement rules list click remove
  implement click rule, update display, watch for offset
  anchor names should not have quotes in them, because disk i/o is easier and I'm lazy
  problems when anchors are on a page that is not at origin?
  check for only align objects that are on pages
  margin area anchors not staying when margins change
  transform relative to alignment point of parent (50,50) for center, for instance
  code
  edge magnet
  when trying to move an anchor when you still need to select invariants, flash the invariants
  need edge indicators for more convenient snapping

privacy/security gotchas to watch out for:
  autolaidoutrc with export settings can potentially save user data in templatevars..
    maybe have special project/autolaidoutrc to save such things?
  file system access in scripts?

gshell:
    needs massive testing
    type "tool." (for instance), you can highlight choice with mouse, but does not insert into edit, only inserts when nothing had been typed
    *** not getting options for all tool and object!!
    searching seems to be messed up, improper matches when mid stream
    mid stream search is messing up match names
    completion should be worked into the edit.. "object.|" then tab is replacing all text with field name
    when in function, search among parameter names also
    need to search for context names before searching for calculator names
    search within area, not total tree
    text delete to nothing should only show the top areas in search results
    thoroughly test object access
    object.translate((1,0)) -> MapParameters should map the flatvector to p, not to x
    shift up/down for showing completion
    reposition cursor to error
    for parameters, facility for special edit dodads

custom tools:
  scripted
  normal tools, but jump to special settings for those tools..

implement marks
  bleed marks
  color bars from a palette
  spread info: spread type, current date and time, creator, spread number/total number of spreads

dynamic objects (generated images, dynamic images, rendered images)
    eps objects to pdf: export as image, plant in PDF as image
    group objects with laidout elements, updateable with script
    image objects using ImageImportFilters
    perhaps add TEX_BIN, LATEX_BIN, and text editor to quickly add stuff like that!!
    external commands:
      website to recommend learn more
      needs what type of file
      needs how many files
      needs what other info
ImageProperties image properties imageinfo image info:
  click for file should show preview... there are two "..." !!
  select file, not updating view?
  In image properties dialog, have the popup list of potential previews
    preview style needs debugging and testing so as not to fry the freedesktop ones

if you change an eps to a non eps with the insert file, it still thinks it is an eps..
 image objects should auto change between the available image formats:
  bitmap--eps--embedded svg--dynamic
  Dynamic Content:
    displayed as images, or displayed as group of laidout objects
    possibly multiple images or objects in linked list:
      one source creates multipage ps, for instance, each page gets its own object
    controller source object:
      generator command + context
   examples:
    ps/tex/pdf/etc to eps files, import the eps files
    broken down equirect panorama to net
Image import chain:
  1. eps|EPS: Laidout builtin
  2. svg|SVG: inkscape command line export
  3. other external renderer: asymptote, structure synth, sunflow, pov-ray, lilypond, latex, graphviz, gnuplot
  3. * images: graphicsmagick
  4. jpg, png, gif, tiff: Imlib2

move Value and FieldPlace to laxkit? ValueHash would be very useful to ease configs

soft masking
    mask object optionally converted to grayscale

pagerangeinterface:
  incorporate IndexRange?
  drag off screen should toggle off
  need overlay close box?
  edit base in place
  should remember old label format strings, to easily select back to them

have option to specify language from command line

reimpose option: center images, but not rescale?

improve split window
  control wheel to expand bevel
  load/save split bevel settings
  debug mouse cursor change when over gap
  simplify pane customization, docking

accordion folds:
  map style
  various pamphlet types
  wacky minimal origami: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__9_KZi_tpE
  maze books / meander scrapbook
  cootie catcher
  explodion books with cross folds on pages

Make extension to be able to use Inkscape live path effects (lpe)!! Then run on svg snippets, so should be somewhat
  straightforward to call externally.. BUT have optional tool overlay. Figure out how to reverse implement to also
  run within Inkscape.

printer mark rendering default to a single color? editing of net outline allowed, but
then changes not stored

probably should decide how to handle making windows based on interfaces.. it is a more productive route than window dominant

import/export styledefs should use the extendsdef mechanism!!!

views with multiple spreads

messages to the status line should have priorities? so once mouse over messages are cleared, it would revert
  back to a lower priority message

WhateverImposition, to only have limbos, but extra handling for exporting
all at once imposition... this would allow mapping of scribus layout without fuss. that
  could be a special case of n-up, where you specify n to be infinity, with m number of
  columns, not necessarily aligned, as scribus does.


templates Templates:
  partial templates, fill in non defined, like use booklet but manually define paper size
  DONE save as default, or just save as.

Master Pages master pages / template pages:
  have objects be tagged with ref object, so you can create a page with a master page
    that has a "text frame" for instance, but different properties per page
    ProxyObjects : public SomeDataRef
      SomeData *proxy_of; // <- object on master page, for instance, but the real ref object is editable
    option to revert edited object to base proxy
  need option to import master pages from scribus docs

some kind of grease pencil?

Saving: multiple documents open, save only the headwindows that refer only to that doc,
OR save no window configs (saved with project), OR save custom configs

need conversions: gradient->color patch
                  image -> imagepatch <- do with image filters rather than specific object type
                  imagepatch -> image
                  colorpatch -> image?
                  engraver -> path
                  path -> engraver
                  text -> path
Convert:
  bool reversible;
  char *from;
  char *to;
  int support; //like how reliable it is to convert, warnings for what is lost
  CanConvert(object, from, to, warnings_ret);
  newobject = Convert(object, to);

file format prettification  --file-format
  dump should differentiate between DrawableObject and pure resource objects... right now, all lumped together
  adapt the scribus xml/att convertor to parse the output of laidout --file-format into something meaningful...
  #-------blah--------  <- mark a new section
    thing      #thing's docs
      subthing #subthing's docs
    #docs for following atts indented same as previous atts
    next_att #(one or more) next_att docs
  DONE make names/values/comments all kind of line up for those that use dump_out_atts

export with limbo, and no doc or papergroup, means use bounding box for limbo?

measure tool.. configure measurements to be:
 displayer units
 object units
 units mapped to either type of units, so can use light years for units that are actually inch physical paper units
have arrows, and write on screen what the size is...


collect for out:
  define directory to pull all files and external resources in
  write out new .laidout file linked for the new system
  define map of  oldfile -> newfile
  name mangling as necessary to prevent clobbering
  need limited collect for only resources used by exported items

    collected/
      images/
      fonts/
      resources/   <- that were laidout resources linked in
      file.laidout with proper links to new dirs
      collect.log  <- what was collected / rasterized?

preflighting:
  steps:
    specify layout and spread range
    specify checking functions
    step through each object
    run checking function(s) on object
    append trouble spots to error log
      needs path to object:  project.limbo / project.doc.page.layer.obj.obj / project.papergroup
      message
      possible remedy
    show window with list of offenders, offer remedies
  check for empty groups
  check for broken images
  check for transparency
  check for bad fonts/missing chars
  compatibility should be determined by file type managers, not individual objects
    return if object is currently compatible with some standard,
    like "PS LL3", "EPS 3.0", "SVG 1.2", "PDF 1.3", "PDF 1.4" "HTML/CSS2"
    1==yes, straight out
    2==yes, but needs rasterizing
    this would simplify preflight checking

maybe expand the page label system to have some kind of to-do markup.. this could be combined with preflight verifiers
  or other search activities as work-in-progress annotations

cloning: convert to master: make a clone be the original..
  means swapping the actual master with the clone
  ..if an object is cloned, maybe just have them all be clones, and original becomes a remote "data block"
      to be dumped to file in a defs section? if all refs gone but one, then it takes place of clone?

for clones, it would be easier to have a "defs" group or something, so deleting the original of a ref will
  not cause problems. When deleting objects, must then take care to update parent, so it is immediately known
  if an object is without a home.

tiling cloner: clone tiler  CloneInterface
  escape doesn't let you go back to object tool
  options:
    show/not-show base + source_clones
    embed origin in pattern
	embed pattern in final
  should have option to apply clones as an object filter, not as actual clones
  should have option to map cell size to cell objects for easier tiling
  default should be use lines only when there is no source object.
  new tiling should update viewport color per basecells
  should not assume preview has I transform
  memory hole back, third time!!!
  radial needs wind scale input
  DONE fill out the Tiling objectdef
  DONE bug: Tiling doesn't save, need to make Tiling be a Value so it can be io with drawable->properties
  DONE various source refs should take names from ref'd objects

  need path morphing
  spiral needs:
    number of spirals: color different for each
	direction of spiral
  need more distinction between what is a base object, and grabbing a copy of existing object.. too easy to confuse the two!
  copies should be selectable, at least so you can adjust the colors: gave current_base, current_copy
  should have z order controls for base cell stuff
  clipping options when source images overlap in final layout
    maybe be able to modify base cell outline, use that as clip? autocorrect for overlapping?
  snap sources to fit/fill in base cell areas
  implement proper shear/aspect protection for:
    allow shear of p1, p2
    allow non-locked aspect of p1,p2,pm,pg,pmm,pmg,pgg,cm,cmm
  highlighting in selection box should draw name next to the thing on hover
  making new id names needs to make unique
  1m and mg do not seem to work: need a final transform to apply, NOT repeatX/YDir().. those shift without rotate
  bug: not showing orientation arrows correctly when outline cuts through middle of bounding box
  really need undo
  save color hints of base cells with Tiling object
  change color of boundary, and outline preview
  select objects, wrap base cell around it
  implement circular interface
  need rudimentary editor
  need flag for ok for cell to shear, ok for cell to scale x/y independently, and have it apply as it should afterwards
  config:
    default line/fill render style (if any)
    boundary outline style
    base cell outline styles
  should have a render preview to show actual grid coverage
  need finishing tool
  design interface for clone on path
  Hirschhorn Medallion, and other pentagon tilings https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling
  truchet tiling
  penrose/heesch/net clone interface
    penrose p1: pentagons, pentagrams, rhombus, sliced pentagram
    penrose p2: kite and dart
    penrose p3: 2 rhombs
  need progressive search when mouse over box
  autocreate seamless tile image
  autofit source objects/images to the pattern to minimize gaps
  map to inkscape tiling clone on export?

Imposition use cases:
  for sig editor, need paper partitioner, then stack sections
  for same document, have stack of impostions, each with its own page set? would make docs with body pages and
    cover easier, without having to implement full "project"
  booklet contains two threads, read one way, flip book over, read the other way
    remember custom views, to swap rotated display, for instance
  booklet but each paper is trimmed differently, like for tabs
  moebius
  need cutting marks for posterizing for lining up different sheets
  impose only needs access to papergroups
  maybe any spread setup temporarily to another imposition on export?

Net imposition
  create from papergroup: one papergroup used as page spreads, another used as actual paper group?
  net extra scaling non-functional
  NetImposition needs import/export net,
  export svg
  convert to/from laidout elements
  interactive unwrapper and build net interface figure out bleeding and connectivity infrastructure
  figure out more efficient clipping of Imlib images
  finish implementing double sided nets
  saving when net is internal is not proper.. does not distinguish between diff. nets and whole
  import/export cff2?
  export pdf 1.6?
  save different setups: papertile AND net layout
  load save nets from: 1.net files or 2.OFF files(done)

polyptych:
  bug: won't set custom net/paper after edit imposition with polyptych
  can't seem to save new bookmarks or use old ones in polyptych, but it's ok in Laidout

hedron window:
  opengl impl needs a modern refresh
  send imp
  receive imp
  remember net and paper placement
  sometimes paper disappears
  tutorial
  auto generate equirectangular -> flat
  reverse project net onto an equirect for export
  highlight paper when dragging will move it
  need to draw other nets in outline (at least) in paper view
  need to preview sides on hedron
  memory hole in polyptych
  file open, preview hedra
  file open, preview equirects
  need to implement more options for polyhedron connections, to allow mobius strips...
  DONE proper units for papers

implement undo.. ideally use same code for both undo and recordable/assignable actions
  object interface
    need to account for:
      DONE dragging matrix changes
      key flip, or non-dragging changes
      object deletion
  nodes
  image
  gradients
  paths
  meshes
    color
    image
  engraver
  inside curve editors
  paper interface
  spread editor
  reimpose
  unwrapper
  metadata stuff
  cloner
  during scripting?!
  saveable?

PlainTextWindow plaintextwindow PlainText plain text window:
  bug: doesn't handle tabs
  need control zoom to change font size
  clicking around doesn't properly update caret drawing
  plain text edit window specify interpreter to process the text with
  DONE PlainTextObjects should be resources

  move selected lines up/down
  regex searching
  jump to line
  jump to previous/next edit (in stack)
  bookmark spots
  option to show line numbers
  indent/unindent selected lines
  toggle expandtab
  comment/uncomment: // or /**/ or #
  indent/unindent
  multicursor edit
  some day should have syntax highlighting in Laxkit::MultiLineEdit

pixels units should be set as per document dpi

CharacterInterface characterinterface
  should show unicode number/glyph name if available
  implement recent
  implement suggestions
  alternate glyphs

Spread editor: SpreadEditor spread editor spreadeditor
  should have border drag to move, not middle drag

python plugin:
  need python implementation of Attribute and class structure in/out to help file importers in other python based environments
  need headless, no-x compile option to allow minimal usage as python plugins for Scribus

limbo transform should be obeyed. It can be moved, scaled, etc,
page layers should be simplified, each layer behaves according to its transform, and more controls inserted to handle layer maneuvering

configurable command buttons to automate certain things with minimal window clutter....

dump OUT an image list? Scribus has "review images" feature.. can jump to location, edit print/view, etc

repeater tool on path: could be adapted to help animation tweening

animation: real time
  animation interface can set laidout->globals.frame, but how best to add callbacks when a Value is modified?
  anything even remotely real time needs serious rewrite of rendering, and use compute shaders opengl? vulcan?
animationinterface animation interface:
  way to set start, end
  way to set fps
  DONE be able to move strip
  DONE make strip an overlay that can trigger filter updates


how to keep track of class hierarchy? impositions are now listed by resource instance, what is
  best way of keeping track of base imposition classes? this is needed for file format description output


polish: ux:
  when you save, also save a preview of current spread in freedesktop thumbs?
  resizeable ui
  should be able to mass disconnect clones
  current page should be highlighted

  in menus, click down, then drag, will return what is under mouse.. should default to not do anything but stay in menu
  page navigator should allow type in shortcuts like "end" or "-2" for second from last

General design usability
to be a decent editing platform, Laidout needs:
  undo/redo
  viewport rendering needs to be far,far better
  master pages with auto page number is important.. for image based page numbers, dynamic objects important!!
  would be convenient to send to gimp for editing, update later live
  when delete/add pages, need option to reposition to same orientation in margin area
  snapping:
    selection snapping: select a bunch of stuff, mark as snap sources, next selection tries to snap against those in old sel, not in new sel
    rotation, maybe drag handle with control?
    snap to bbox vs aabb
  drag constraints more accessible in only y or x direction
  per object visibility
  per object opacity
  better key shortcut edits, right click on menu items to ch key
  guides
  text
  Grouping:
    select only within group zone
    easy selection of proper group zone
    remove 'i' from common shortcuts for all tools to let it be used for ObjectIndicator
  DONE more specific control over transform.. numerical specification
  DONE clipping



============== Future of Laidout ================

Goals:
  2D Vector graphics editor built for multiple output types, such as multi-page physical prints, html, or image files
  While 2D focused, has some limited capabilities to lay out on 3d surfaces made out of flat but bent or folded surfaces
Current deficiencies:
  Render update is way too slow
  Too many bugs/quirks in object management, resource coordiation
  undo/redo barely implemented
  cairo is only 8 bit, limits use for animation
  Way too hard to have user created tools
    internal object system is flexible, but not without a huge amount of boilerplate-like code to tie to scripter
  Being Linux only limits user base, and thus also limits user testing
  no color management
  raster/paint/editable image layers, or stroke based on non-destructive vector paths would help
  too many complex custom systems is not attractive to new devs
Considerations:
  Pure svg/pdf vector graphics is limiting, current custom format is very flexible
  Game engine-esque, real time animation and 3d tools are rising in importance as everyone aquires powerful cheap devices
  Compute shader/ graphics shaders are very powerful and should be used for speed and image effects
Ways forward:
  maybe gegl-ify everything?
   - fixes 8 bit limit
   - babl flexibility
   - cross code with gimp/gegl has long term benefits
   - gegl already can access hardware acceleration for many things
  consider gigantic revamp so that ui is all made with python..
   - essentially the blender route
   - makes tool development way more accessible to new users



===================Consider anything below here food for thought, not active dev notes================
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
for translations, there is a difference between locale translations and language translations!
  not sure if it is worth paying attention to... need to investigate if locale as it affects keyboard input
  is separate from what locale we read in translations from. If it is distinguishable, that is fabulous, in that
  we can maintain the current locale key input, but change the language translation at will...

investigate pdfcreator as method to reduce file size
