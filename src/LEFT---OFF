This file is for random notes and specific coding tasks that need to be done
to meet various goals. This includes Roadmap items as well as fixing bugs.
List bug tracker number if any.

When an item is satisfied, put it in the DONE section at bottom of file.
Those are purged with each release.



--------------bugs: things that do not work like they are already allegedly designed to---------------------


------------ serious bugs to fix right now:

bug: window sizes seem to all be off a few pixels

bug: curve is terrible approximation at end points

ftgl problem in polyptych... font not rendering

finish debugging mesh svg 2.0 out/in

debug registration, cut marks, trim marks
  custom papergroup, add registration/bars/, can't move it
  DONE can't add cut marks to signatures

object indicator:
  click on object, does not update selection

back to not maximizing properly on default ubuntu. Seems to work fine on every other window manager I've tried.

svg out, select to files, often the first time goes to file, not files


------------ other bugs:

Reconfigure text edits. Need something that works in interface land, with harfbuzz

drag off page, space to duplicate, copy is not in limbo!
duplicate does not duplicate clip_path

packaging woes: update deb/control to have more of the dependencies

booklet, use paper group tool, default paper group no longer displays

evince on ubuntu 14.04, pdf export won't load, says Syntax Error... Dictionary key must be a name object

configure should check for libreadline-dev? apparently not pkg-config ready <- half fix of listing in package requirements
  needs to use the new extra_cppflags thing

scroll bar zoom handles don't appear to work

memory hole in reimpose .. reimposed 5 page booklet
memory hole when graphical shell activated
memory hole do laidout -n letter, split a window, then quit. undeleted Objects remain!
memory hole delauneyinterface
memory hole helpwindow -> probably something to do with ShortcutWindow and ShortcutTreeSelector not refcounting as expected
DONE memory hole paper interface, activate tool, lay down one paper, quit, 3 objects remain
DONE memory hole cairo backend (can't duplicate)

"edit imposition", then escape.. removes window, but not the frame!

lineinput not propagating escapable

clones of images scale not like images.. should also snap aspect to start of drag, not when control key pressed

select none, select doc, viewport jumps around... it should stay the same area
switch to None document, and units change to unreasonable



shearing or scaling produces null axes occasionally when crossing over opposite edge, borking the display
  --> seems to be only when needing to draw images on close to parallel axes, doesn't seem do it with paths

bug: page progress popup is wrong place, and mouse maps at wrong scale ONLY OCCASIONALLY, hard to reproduce

sometimes crash at insert page before (?? can't duplicate)

text window controls have difficulties
  doesn't handle tabs
  (see PlainTextWindow below for feature plans instead of bugs)

saving window positions doesn't take into account window decorations, makes pos slide downward each time
  _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS? _KDE_NET_WM_FRAME_STRUT? how to get before mapping a window?

scribus plugin: if directory of executable script is not writable, it fails!
 -> should find one that is writable
scribus plugin needs a proper dealing with temporary files

object reordering (with home/end) produces outline of unrelated objects on top

don't allow reparent to a child!! or reparent as appropriate

need to implement ObjectInterface/GroupInterface::DrawData()

cloning, change original, not triggering bbox update in clone

ubuntu maximize window failing (but not on today's debian unstable gnome), resize seems to work now
gnome "application" does one per window, not one per app. this is not a bad thing imnsho, but should be easy to conform to desktop application spec properly
icon needs to be bigger.. is fuzzy on ubuntu alt-tab
DONE App/window icon in window manager not showing..

DONE??? need to implement scale pages to new imposition when reimposing (enable in doc settings dialog)

splitwindow SplitWindow:
create new pane should dup old pane.. currently divide viewport, removes document focus
viewwindow, change to spreadview, change back to view.. Horizontal ruler origin is REALLY off
splitwindow cursors existing in subwindows
create new window, defaults to no doc. should select doc of last pane
headwindow swapping is now REALLY messed up
pane swapping/dropto on maximized, swapping in general...

svg out, EquivalentObject doesn't play nice with defs.. only accessed once.. how to upkeep clones in this case?
	-> when equiv objects are composed of groups, what happens?
svg coord numpoints==0???? numpoints doesn't really serve any purpose other than debugging, but....
svg to coord incomplete: arcs needs testing
memory hole in svg in? test svg import, svg path import must be done


sigimp fail for multiple stacks with no folds!!

make sure all imposition types are available in interpreter

resource impositions not showing description when selected

fold indicator foldprogress just at crossover points incorrectly indicating affected folds


object tool shift-control for rotate does not allow positioning on drag bars

'g' for color sample changes cursor to cancel now, and changes on border cross!!!
Need better mouse shape support

possible modifier-pairing error with multiple mice...

object deleting funky, import svg images, select one, hit delete, doesn't delete!!
place 3 images, object select, must press delete twice...!?!?!?!

should not be able to group select an object and another object nested within

file previewer not updating preview when using arrow keys

shrink image lets you go immeasurably small

GradientInterface problem rendering radial when two circles separated by large distance

WATCH OUT for when preview file is OLDER than original file!!

stackframe seems to be ignoring window borders on layout


----------------0.098 ROADMAP ITEMS: features and enhancements------------------------
website: explain a bit more how to install dev versions, and place side by side with "stable"
website: need to redo screenshots section for mobile friendliness
update fileformat.txt
check laidout.1 when time to release
update docs to have new release number
update translation base files
update screenshots, sync with features
update links page
update help page
update dtpcompare.html
comment out cairo_debug_reset_static_data before release, since it usually means crash, interferes with pipeout
run through "valgrind --leak-check=full --error-limit=no ./laidout" and fix anything that can be nailed down to laidout
test:
  ./laidout ../examples/test-all-objects.laidout
  each export filter (via command line in new script in examples.. ignoring problems in eps)
  each window type: about palette view spread command text
    help: window pane does funky stuff
  test in different window managers
  make some test scripts for command line testing


get splash image working

lgm 2019 feedback and ideas:
  configure still sucks.. 
    laidout configure needs to drive laxkit configure more thoroughly.
    shouldn't need the '='
  path tool:
    hard to see helper graphics, needs haloing
	should have space to dup weight node
  be able to load old docs
  method to fix all broken images at once
    option: do just this one, or fix all
	old path: _____     new path: _____
  method to collect all used resources of a doc for distribution
  from here on out, ensure backwards compatibility of files still works
    enhance mystery data to work with laidout data too?
  some kind of graphicsmagick LoadToMemory bug.. could be only on loading old file, bad config translation?
  out clicking from a dialog should probably destroy that dialog.. too easy to get buried confusedly in windows
  automate default laxkit detection, or git download of laxkit if missing
  mageia:
    makedepend trouble? replace with custom script to get rid of x11-dev dependency?
  make connecting to information easy: click to open web browser
  diffusion curves
  "local mod" mesh manipulation


alternate packaging:
  appimage
  flatpak
  snapcraft
  debian (get in to main repository)

panel editing:
  svg not exporting images when they are children of other non-group objects
  selecting objects really sucks
  data-data-
  bulk assign meta
  meta edit:
    should allow both name+value for new
  parenting and unparenting really sucks
    options should be:
	  Jump to parent --hover to show what is the parent
	  Unparent
	  Parent under first --hover to show potential parent 
	  Parent under last --hover to show potential parent 

gif flipbooks:
  mod to center trims in sig editor
  need a revert to last save option
  for one offs, need to implement progressive repeat imposing
  auto format partition so final page size has same aspect as image
  sig editor needs number input

need something like laximages->Save(file, format, native_save_only), in case object doesn't know how to save to that format.. maybe default to something like static ImageLoader::Save

need ability to show "reprocessing.." or "progress.." indicator in different thread to what is actually processing
  must multithread long operations

in singles view, spread number in box should be page label instead of spread number

export current appears to be broken

object content selector menu

object clipping:
  menu should bold the object names.. hard to read as is
  applying clip path should not destroy path's style settings
  clip path shouldn't have to be a path.. be able to be text, or whatever provides an Area path
  generate default clip path for editing from area path or bounding box
  clip-path export: pdf(done), image(done), svg(done), scribus
  page object bleed export: DONE pdf, DONE image, DONE svg, scribus
  DONE page previewer in spread editor doesn't use bleeds.. need to refresh thumbs if has bleeds
  DONE in place editing
  DONE apply, remove, extract clip path

need a better file preview system
  need to wrap laidout_preview_maker(), which previews EPS with the help of gs

save as needs to use current save path, not current directory

valuewindow:
  ui hints:
    DoubleRectangle      [maxy]
	                 [minx]  [maxx]
					     [miny]
    AffineValue:  [xx] [xy] {scale x} {rotation} 
	              [yx] [yy] {scale y} {shear}
				  [x0] [y0]
  setvalue
  arrayvalue
  ValueHash
  rearrange
  delete elements of list
  scrolledwindow:
    errant scroller visible, pops on and off
	when scroller visible, not adjusting thewindow size properly
  when you quit, does not remember from open windows

ux:
  when you save, also save a preview?
  resizeable ui
  should be able to mass disconnect clones
  current page should be highlighted

instead of _LAX_PLATFORM_MAC, do relevant check with _LAX_ON_NON_GNU instead? currently only place this is necessary is where getline is used

remove imlib/"xlib" font, image, and render backends, replace with GraphicsMagick and cairo, keep imlib loader but load to cairo image only
  remove displayer-xlib
  remove fontmanager-xlib

image loaders:
  implement loader priorities
  some way to prioritize image saving

dual monitors:
  open in same screen as mouse
  when you open a new window, ensure that it is always on screen
  DONE Menus should respect actual screen borders, not just full virtual screen

cairo:
  cairo image save should use importer to do non-file creation?
  cairo render has color problems with gradients
  cairo development is dead? investigate alternatives

importing: image import:
  need drag and drop from system for multi-image import
  cannot import images directly from recents
  need thumbnail preview of images in directories
  when you have a filter, should still show directories(?)

pdf export lines has outlines in evince?

debug inkscape node extension

text on path textonpath: TextOnPath
  convert to path rendering to wrong place and orientation
  doesn't handle transforms with nested objects properly
  dragging size handle with shift|control does not scale properly
  convert to path: not respecting transform, putting upside down(done)
  select font, key up/down scrolls uncomfortably SOMETIMES!!

  envelope:
    vertical position bad
	horizontal spacing a bit wonky
  bug: drag the baseline handle off to the sides, makes huge bad jumps in value
  bug: dragging the offest handle sometimes jumps to really bad
  handle to remove from current path, and possibly attach it to some other path
  glyph positioning is wrong
  position glyphs based on middle of glyph, not start of glyph

PathInterface: pathinterface
  bug: seems to be possible to move nodes out of order, only occassionally
  bug: shift click down then up on a point selects then deselects.. control can toggle
  bug: problems for non-bez-controlled corners at endpoint. Also variable offset causes weird connections
  bug: applyoffset, the bez part at joins is messed up when no offset, suspect problem in FlatpointToCoordinate, mismatch with bez join next to sample points

  bug: should not create new control points by pressing cntl, unless there is movement
  bug: delete last weight node, sometimes width is wrong
  bug: make new line with freehand tool, cannot move weight nodes in a rational way



Find interface:
  search by name and/or type, description, other meta, broken images, other preflight things, etc.
  find next or find all, all shows selection of thumbs
  mass operations on found objects

in menus, click down, then drag, will return what is under mouse.. should default to not do anything but stay in menu

layers palette Layers
  key controls for navigation within menu:
    space/enter toggle open and closed submenu
  edit colors not highlighting every other
  move
  rename in place
  implement buttons
  locked
  visible
  selectable

  should have document list at top, showing current doc

have an actual splash image shown

you can't control unclick selected directories

build: building:
  in config.log should show actual configure line for easy duplicating
  should update faq with details about graphicsmagick, harfbuzz, and gegl versioning

rework ui to be programmable. Perhaps an ui builder

file filters: filefilters:
  multiple export targets, including per object export settings
  config resource load/save
  need to ensure that when bouncing around filters, Export All sets range properly
  need to preserve last settings per filter
  would be nice to standardize viewport display so each exporter doesn't have to implement everything themselves
    like define an iterator to walk over the view
  fix when filtered object has children.. currently skips children
  open with... on export
  remember full export settings
  need createImportConfig/createExportConfig to make ImportConfig/DocumentExportConfig objects from parameters for all filters....
  need equirectangular out
  selecting out should auto select tofile | tofiles, depending on how many spreads selected for out
  export ranges should accept "1-4, 6, 20-25" and "5-1", or by name "iii - iv"
  perhaps switch export/import objects to new cascading Style as base..
  standardize basic load such that non-laidout files create new document of proper size then import
  When there are errors or warnings in exporting, should be able to have the error log such that
    you can just jump to the offending bit easily. This would also be used for preflight verifiers,
    and maybe also mass edit things, like edit all images..
    - have ViewWindow::JumpToObject(&place, objectid);
importdialog ImportDialog import dialog:
  should show filename as red if don't know how to import
  import option to preserve broken links
  importing should not spawn new windows
  importing should sort out duplicate names
  would be nice to show preview of what is to be imported
html: htmlgallery: html out htmlout:
  webcomic features:
    parallax
      auto gyrate
      control over parallax point
 	  autoplay repeating parallax elements
    follow mouse
    video objects as mystery data?
    path follow
    scrolling object: speed direction
    shake
    clip paths
    css 3d transforms
  specify image file name, also preview file name "###-s.png"
  DONE implement save and load template vars
  DONE include scrim in coop/html
  DONE figure out template scheme
  DONE standardize save to directory or file, not just assume file
image
  export depth map based on metadata z
  export format should be an enum. need to extract possible save formats from Laxkit
  option for setting background color, at least white|transparent
  for gs, make sure temp file is removed, should probably locate in user space maybe? or make sure perms set reasonably
laidout export:
  need a Laidout out! for partial exports, or conversions between nets/papergroup lines/etc
  implement crop
  save option to force path data into svg d style instead of default laidout style
  save option to not output line caches
laidout import:
  pops up spurious windows
  maybe option to create new layers, or insert to existing layers?
  option to insert new pages, or merge onto existing pages
  need to center within new margin area, as compared to previous margin area
  partial import of page ranges
  selective import, like blender has:
    import of resources
    import of master pages
    import of limbos
pdf: PDF:
  export clones adds extra ref in resources section
  text out very broken.. imageout via gs complains about malformed pdf on fonts
  fonts are not doubled up, each text object is exporting its own

  export complex engraving is really, really slow. probably all the string reallocation?
  pdf optimize jpg dump, compress image data
  still true? pdf export if a path has null linestyle/fillstyle it buffers until next path drawn
     instead of drawing with some default style
  pdf out needs clone deref.. needs clone deref still?
  graphicsmagick for import? subimage and subrange of image_info passed to ReadImage
  page labels?
  implement crop
Scribus scribus:
  outputting with settings that result in 0 pages result in scribus crash
  caption as path flips
  implement equivalent object
  caption export centering
  export paths fails on compound paths. scribus has dichotomy Polyline|Polygon
  scribus export should show actual version export
  make sure it works for 1.5.2
  check for updates in file format for 1.5
  export color meshes, for recent versions of Scribus

  page clipping
  import/export color meshes, for recent versions of Scribus
  font size confusion
  import/export linear and radial gradients
  scribus in/out: font sizes, stroke widths
  import should try to apply the Scribus layout correctly, at least for 2 page spreads
  import should do something meaningful with original Scribus page bleed values
  scribus import: need to read page sizes from actual page attributes, as it may well be different than in document attributes
    -> this necessitates revamp of singles to use more than one paper type
  implement crop
svg: SVG
  export papers current not going to correct paper
  text on path without path conversion
  rudimentary mesh in.. try to scale and place as separate object (without proper clipping)
  dump_in filter to nodes optionally
  need to parse units
  in needs to account for viewBox
  in needs to parse "use" elements and other "#" refs
  in for powerstroke
    on read in width nodes are zeroed, does not correspond to actual width of line
    some other dup nodes causing bad stroke approximation in some of the stuff that magically disappears
    can't get at the weight nodes after import
    after in: nodes right on each other produce bad vectors
    after in, does weird things with width node -> child objects not display correctly
  radial: transparent inner circle, patch edges
  out: text linespacing.. unclear how Msize/linespacing maps to svg options
plan:
  need an In()
  implement paper rotation for out
ppt:
  implement crop
  implement paper rotation
ps:
  implement paper rotation
  for plain postscript, there's bitmask, but no transparency. maybe optionally do simulation with dithered bitmask..
    a lot of work for a deprecated format, but could have other uses, like for PDF/X-1a
  paths not filling correctly
  engraver no out, equiv object problem?
  implement crop
eps:
  implement crop
  export seems to be rather broken
  command line export file name defaults to "output#.eps"
  implement paper rotation
xtg from quark?
idml from indesign?

PathInterface: pathinterface
  that hot new spiro curve
  boolean ops
  mirror, array, with join (akin to blender modifiers)
  need to show hints for when new points will be placed
  dup path object links the path style, but save and load, it is not linked... need to sort out line/fill style inheritance/linking
  needs input boxes for width nodes
  compound paths, change width only changes one. no way to affect all
  need a way to work on multiple weight nodes:
    shift all
	width multiply all
	set width
  need input boxes for weight node info
  zero tips not working on mesh edit? with import test-engrave.laidout
  debug cache sample point distribution, the interpolator is really bad as is
  powerstroke export requires apply offset.. else weight nodes are all messed up
  clarify export for weighted paths, use outlinecache and areacache as needed, check all filetypes exporters: svg pdf scribus image/ps/eps
  finish implementing joins. need to clarify weight behavior at corner joins
  weight computation is currently done based on even t spacing, but probably should be mapped based on distance
  interfs.cc: weights not being shown unless '_'
  be able to pull points back along path near endpoints

  debug extrapolate
  implement open at any point to possibly break into separate subpaths
  need numerical entry for all weight node characteristics
  need to protect against reentrants at corner joins.. makes holes unless nonzero rule, and sometimes sticks out the other side
  sliding around the nodes is really annoying.. should do according to proximity to center line
  inkscape has multiple interpolators, we should too!
  actions to implement:
    need arbitrary cut
    need command to apply offset
    need path combine (combine path stacks of multiple PathsData)
    need break apart (make new PathsData from each in paths stack)
    need special break apart to make new PathsData, but preserve totally enclosed paths as intential holes
    need mechanism to be able to add custom path actions to context menu
  implement work on multiple path objects at once
  ApplyTransform() and MatchTransform() should adjust scaling of width nodes?
  custom caps.. define cap to a horizontal line, take endpoints and endpoint tangents, return the cap warped to fit the tangents
  custom dashes, with custom start/end dash caps
  need some kind of extrema fill in for angled paths, so it matches sweep of whole segment, not just endpoint sweep lines
  should have shortcut to offset ALL weight nodes, or angle ALL nodes
  how to deal with bbox when using wacky weights?? -> use bbox of outlinecache (or centercache), non-weighted (optional): use flat bbox + linewidth
  need something like path->PointInfo(t, &pp, &vprev_ret, &vnext_ret).. done is GetWeight(t, &width, &offset, &angle)
  maybe should revisit PathOperator stuff, such as for spiro paths
  need way to turn off selectability of path points (thus leaving only width nodes selectable)
  per vertex join type?
  linestyles are always output independently, can't currently cascade with current code
  if background is green or red, hard to see the direction indicator
  line join round should add extra point for really wide angles to make them more circular

  copy and paste
  maybe dotted connection if only both end points selected, click connection to close?
  maybe control when on vertex will create whichever handle does not exist, control nearest drag point determines which is created
  not show every single handle. only ones associated with active vertices, show unactive vertices with small circles
  align nodes -> create temp set of data to pass to AlignInterface?
  transform handles for nodes, including flip
  subdivide, repeat key press restores old segment, then adds 1 more point to num of points from last press
  toggle between add points / select points?
    if add points, show dotted line to indicate a new segment incoming
  finish new path/pathoperator/pathsubinterface/pathinterface structure
  have a widthtype == hairline? use width==0 as no stroke

engraving tool: Engraving  engraver
  bug: trace object opacity is not working for non-image trace objects.. stroke and fill needs mask integration!!
  bug: 'z' zaps mesh, but does not change cache border or point mapping

  cairo render NEEDS VAST IMPROVEMENT.. the clunky xlib approximation was fast, but not transferrable to cairo

  multiobject:
    object lines in group list needs eye per object, affect actual object visibility
	need to enforce resource unique names
    need ability to store overall styles of a patch, not just each individually
	on resource menus, should check mark if current matches a resource??

  orient:
    should adjust all linked
    with test-engrave-trace2.laidout, do the quick adjust, does not preserve width the first time, using old value of thickness?
    option to remember old values while adjusting position, rotation, spacing
     -> when manual tweaking of spacing, need to produce value reference so that future line orienting preserves line thicknesses

  tracing:
    seems to be grabbing spurious tracing values outside of the tracing object, and at borders of trace object
    tracing object, lines abort just inside the image, maybe should just go one off the edge?
	trace object needs flip, at least h and v, not really needing the whole affine thing
    need option to export trace object in same position as the traced lines, so it can be further processed elsewhere
    custom sample of channels
    sharp edge detection in tracing
	snapshot should be for all in selection
	shift-drag (or drag anything not covered by trace object) should drag ANY of the meshes in selection, not just current
	when multi objects, the traceobject is interweaved, based on draw order, only under current object, should be under all?
	make gradient interface work in trace mode

  freehand/path:
    freehand not being interpreted correctly: non-equal smooth is adding erroneous extra mesh column
    drawing custom freehand (with width) lines within the mesh area

  mesh path:
    'a' not selecting all in line

  curvemap needs predefined ramp profiles, remember last, load/save (per context?)
    -> options to insert various predefined patterns
	need magnify do dads for easy expanding of countour without having to place each and every node

  direction:
    need accuracy modifiers for dragging controls around
	only when at endpoints, lineprofile not producing smooth results at random spots inside
    should be able to adjust number of sample points to match up well enough for points in lineprofile
    random end point sliders should inc or dec according to which side mouse clicked down on compared to absolute end point
    spiral spacing computation bad when spokes are nearer radial
    save the opensimplex line displacement from line/point randomness, to be used to also adjust a spacing map to preserve value when viewed at a distance
	be able to trigger a reline on load in
	be able to set a 3-d parameter for noise? useful for animated noise
	option for "adjust for spacing", making weight reflect the spacing, either for constant width or trace
    line profiles: (done) linear, circular, radial, spiral?
	be able to edit and create new profiles
	grow
	spiral arm count makes poor resolution
    line generation:
      grow: implement custom line merge and break to preserve spacing across mesh contraction
      grow: edge abutment when generating
      sample point generation should be based on lines per mesh square, not total mesh field
      finish implementing spacing section -> spacing map

  add special group: half offset, perpendicular
  need stroke+fill options?
  need convert to path object ability
  current blockout is not very precise, needs approximation between existing point samples
  fully implement resolution adjustments for auto lines -> needs resolution tool
  single group (not group list) view is too old, doesn't do link circle, and can only select from current object groups.. remove it entirely?
  export doesn't work for: nothing for scribus, eps, ps
  edit brush ramp as symmetric ramp
  resolution tool: click to add between points within brush, control to destroy points in brush
  need merge group

  screen view, need option for Fast|Accurate
  no writability check on exportsnapshot
  allow temp override of linked to adjust only current?
  establish path needs better smoothness assignments
  keys being caught in patch, not in child path
  test: bez cache needs updating when points are moved around
  test: dash cache needs updating when points are moved OR thickness changed
  always brings current object to front (normal refresh in place, and then interface draw on top).. should be very optional, as it blocks out white overlays
  don't warp, move points, then warp, almost always has bad points: PatchData::getPointReverse() is too inaccurate
  undo/redo
  finish implement making the circle lines be closed circles
  need some kind of smooth out: smooth out width, and smooth out path
  hover over mode icons should show text of what you are hovering over (verbose mode?).. hard to remember, annoying to look at status bar otherwise
  should be able to draw a line and have that be a baseline for dash division
  option: either drop out of bounds points, or zap mesh to point bounds
  numsliders should have click on arrows for single increase, and a dismiss x for input box
  should probably abstract control panel creation so we don't have to hardcode everything all the time
  sampling could be more sophisticated, currently just grabs pixels, could downsample the image based on current spacing
  Danger! coons patch produces discontinuous contours within multiblock meshes!! who knew!?
  perhaps allow path objects to be adjusted with engrave tool for custom outlier lines not part of mesh?
  must implement mode based shortcuts in Laxkit. currently all mesh shortcuts are active
  stippling/decal mode, each sample is either a point, or map on an arbitary object, or sampled object?
    per stipple, adjust rotation, scale, color, morph

text (see also src/text/text.txt):
  need options per font on export to: convert to path, subset, embed
  need standard way to have default font, apart from defaultlaxfont, as well as default color/other visual attributes
  global font list, finish implementing uniquinizing font names, need final step of some kind of file name diff
  freetype/fribidi/harfbuzz all over everything?
  interface base for utf8 based editing.. share this with window edits somehow
  maybe fonts should point to their creators to make duplication more reliable if there are more than just default fontmanager
  need support for font substitution
  harfbuzz support
  math mode
  track bookmarks
  inline graphics
  css import/export
  tabs on arbitrary paths
  google font import

text on path textonpath: TextOnPath
  need kern control
  kern handles
  mouse click to position caret
  need to do proper coordinate finding for mouseposition when paste into a nested group
  copy
  offset from stroke or from path
  click for new, then save, saves a blank one! probably issue in captioninterface also
    need to only add to the document only after there is non-null text, like add_on_change flag
  bbox should be better.. currently is a wide approximation
  option to auto expand line
  stretch envelope
  rotation handle
  drag out line to define chain connection
  multiline?

from big import:
  load in seems to wholely load images, instead of only grabbing info
  need some kind of "loading" indication when loading in large images
  load in of many images needs threaded load
  need image path mass reassign
  spread editor:
    need a force thumb refresh, or actually make modified propagation work
    there should be a paper view for previewing purposes
    select all for current marker type
	arrange in rows at current scale not scaling and placing correctly
	crash during thumbnail generation if you delete pages while there are still some to render

  selecting ranges
  for images, need edit image feature, with watch for changes, or "reload image"
  image dialog, select new image, hangs on imlib complain about null image
  save as should have sample file names: from directory name with ".laidout", incremented from any *.laidout
  export directory should default to last loaded file
  large images all being loaded in, need way to ask about creating proxy images. only img info is supposed to be read in until img data is actually needed
  need better ui for selecting templates
  load in autosave should ask if you want to save as the original
  spread editor needs edge dragging

Perspective perspective:
  finish debugging update path object without reallocating each time
  optimize the image mapping
  filtering paths needs to detect big distortions and add points, as simply transforming bez points is not enough

      progressive search
  need a way to collect custom property types, so they can be added to custom nodes
  for connecting, drop onto a property at all should link, not just on slot
  for preview resizer, shouldn't have it when preview is too tiny, since then usually you want to move the node, not resize

Whenever there's a byte read in, like with read_in_whole_file to string, really should do some minimal string validation before using it?

resource manager needs to store unknown objects as Attribute trees, so they can still be preserved
  for future processing. for instance, be able to recover from when a plugin is missing

need to implement DRAW_Hires for all interfaces that default to preview renders. needed for proper image out
  includes at least image(done), path, engraver

mousemove decorations shouldn't change when an interface absorbs one

color strips for full transparent should show checkers in all strips, not just the alpha strip

MenuInfo AddItem functions are really terrible overload nightmare, need something simpler like, with no menu combined:
  AddItem      (const char *name, int id = 0, int info = 0, int where = -1);
  AddIconItem  (const char *name, LaxImage *icon, int id = 0, int info = 0, int where = -1);
  AddToggleItem(const char *name, LaxImage *icon, int id, int info, int state, int where = -1);

plugins:
  figure out proper de-loading.. have to restart?
  check for already loaded

captioninterface CaptionInterface captiondata CaptionData
  bug: bitstream vera sans, "Text" convert to path puts e correct, but screen render puts it out too far. huh??
  implement proper pdf export
  color fonts: consider native otf:
    Mozilla and Adobe’s svg table, microsoft's colr/cpal, Google’s PNG images (CBDT/CBLC tables), Apple’s PNG images (SBIX table)
	freetype dev branch maybe supports colr/cpal and google's way?
  implement the different layout modes: rtl ttb
  debug for rtl and vertical as returned by hb, or set explicitly with direction
  right to left (figure out how to do with harfbuzz)
  need to do proper coordinate finding for mouseposition when paste into a nested group
  text to path:
    option to do all one path,
	or separate objects per character (or glyph), but clones of a resourced group of glyphs
  need handy option to mirror, instead of escaping to object tool
  need handling when opening a file and the font is not found!!!!!!!  options for substitution
  opentype variations
  select, copy
  for overstretched alignment, bounding box not updating correctly
  should adapt from multiline edit, since it already has cut/paste, selections, and is mostly debugged??
  control-u hack for poweruser unicode character insertion
  use selected text as sample when popping up font dialog
  lorem ipsum
  markov ipsum

export/print dialog
  need better print dialog.. old ppd cups stuff is deprecated
  make print button experimental only?
  vital to debug send to printer
  export should have a preview of what is actually going out, flip through spreads
  in papergroups with multiple papers and double sided impositions, need to ensure front and back are output properly for printer

clean up filefilter.h definition to allow explicit declaration of ObjectFilter in DrawableObject

fontdialog: FontDialog
  need a way to remember layered fonts, to easily activate and deactivate
    read from standard fonts places, like .config/laidout/(version)/fonts
  favorites: tag and column
  user tags, not just fontmatrix tags, option to update fontmatrix?
  should be able to access list of font favorites, and a user's preferred organization of fonts..
  need to implement load specific file for a font

  makeinwindow SOMETIMES not working, select one, puts on bottom line
  font->SetFromFile() should do more fontconfig checking to grab propper file+family+style+size
  FindFont() is faulty, as it only lookes up family/style.. should search by the unique file name
  sometimes family+style is not unique, but has different languages.. should detect this
    use postscriptname: "DroidSansHebrew-Bold" -->  "Droid Sans Hebrew"/"Bold"

  bookman font style names getting chopped off: due to name collision and using psname as reported by fontconfig
    this is unreliable! need to have proper unique font naming
  sample block should be multiline
  need support for svg fonts.. useful for pure svg fonts, and opentype svg, see cairo user fonts
  pgup and down doesn't select a reasonable one
  fontconfig directory config options
  should REALLY have a LayerFont head containing the whole list, not a stand alone list which causes too many problems
  figure out why some color fonts are not scanned by fontconfig
  needs line spacing slider
  option to search by spacing, ie monospace, see fontconfig: FC_PROPORTIONAL, FC_DUAL, FC_MONO, FC_CHARCELL
  vague search via fontconfig matching, to find a match for something like a "sans"

  font preview column in list, custom sample
  language coverage search
  select default language/script
  select opentype features
  optional common font finishers? like centering, underline, color, highlight, fg/bg, etc

ImagePatch:
  use float or double for color sample
  abstract to be a filter, with optional stand alone object

Clean up mesh/patch controls: Mesh PatchInterface
  perspective arrangement: approximate transform controls through perspective grid
  maybe should not be able to escape off path tool when editing as path
  reverse lookup is not very precise: need to warp back and forth ONLY when necessary, as when
    switching to different, non-point-distort mode

  edit multi objects in mesh tool.. should be able to move around many nodes?
  coons are not really smooth at internal edges? try with engraver, makes corners with current inner interpolation
  tracing infrastructure should be part of base mesh class.. would make easy for color mesh to use
  when on edge, it highlights, but if you are outside of mesh, it will switch to other object
  smooth edit mode should be default. It's not working when more than one square
  smooth edit fails along edges
  rotate/scale single control point should move attached controls in smooth mode
  add new patches should smoothify joins when in smooth edit

  just as moving edges, should be able to move any vert column or horizontal row of points
  selected nodes should probably be colored, just gray disappears, hard to work with
  maybe have status message say how many points are selected
  nudge mode with shift?
  rect select nodes
  for cache preview, only update affected patches.. difficult to compute when overlaps
  changing recurse and rendermode in patch controls doesn't change that setting in the instance that does random rendering!!
  implement more right button config options to make the settings more discoverable
  circle warp needs a proper circle/ellipse interface
  make base path dump_out as Path, not PathsData? make it easier to read file removing the unnecessary??

raster paint layers, mypaint?

newdoc:
  when change number of named paper, make it "custom"
  open on image should create a new singles with default paper and image centered

save as should change save/import/export/current directory to that directory
  -> need to test current behavior

TreeSelector:
  click open jumping current to 0
  with text colors, mouse over highlight is off (can't dup?!?)
  not showing alternate gray/white bgs (can't dup?!?)
  option to use markup for labels
  tree display flat option
  makeinwindow() doesn't account for columns

Units:
  need something like Convert(value, units_from, units_to, &error, overrides), where overrides is
    something like: list of [units_id, newscaling], like for temp redefining "Em" or "px"

collect for out: define directory to pull all files and external resources in, including the .laidout file

General design usability
to be a decent editing platform, Laidout needs:
  undo/redo
  master pages with auto page number is important.. for image based page numbers, dynamic objects important!!
  would be convenient to send to gimp for editing, update later live
  when delete/add pages, need option to reposition to same orientation in margin area
  snapping rotate, maybe drag handle with control?
  drag constraints more accessible in only y or x direction
  more specific control over transform.. numerical specification
  per object visibility
  per object opacity
  better key input edits, right click on menu items to ch key
  guides
  text
  Grouping:
    select only within group zone
	easy selection of proper group zone
	remove 'i' from common shortcuts for all tools to let it be used for ObjectIndicator
  DONE clipping

polish:
  page navigator should allow type in shortcuts like "end"

GroupInterface groupinterface ObjectInterface objectinterface:
  default hide draggable flip, but have as right click option
  viewport should fully utilize Selection::CurrentObject(), keep curobj in sync
  double click on group should change selection area to group contents?
    need to clarify how grouping operates. Perhaps implement sets at same time
    clearCurobj() with skim to group for group->double click?
  implement move to "Some other page..." when 'm' in groupinterface
  things to allow editing of wrap, inset, clip paths, and chains
  maybe show flip and 90 deg rotate handles only when mouse outside the selection area?
  control-move flip line to snap to horizontal, vertical, 45 deg, or common gravity points

ObjectIndicator objectindicator:
  current should be bold
  need ability to click on object to select that object. Rename only when already selected
  allow drag reparenting
    hover over parents to pop list of alternate children to reparent to
  show (root) at bottom of stack

voronoi Voronoi delauney Delauney:
  is double rendering when object is selected
  importing raw points or data without matrix should map so that it all appears on screen
  intersect with page bounds? or other custom boundary? default bounding box + padding?
  implement show_points
  implement as extension for delauney/voronoi interface
  right click
    start new object
	toggle delauney lines
	toggle voronoi lines
	toggle points
  auto fill with randomized colors
  merge different voronoi objects
  sample point color from background?
  less than three points doesn't remap rationally, need to update extra lines to something proper

FileDialog filedialog:
  focus should start on file line
  ^l should shift focus to file line
  when something is not openable or saveable, buttons should be greyed out
  should probably have a scroll bar
  implement icon list selector
  implement option for (or just show) directories first
  Resizing zaps view to top, should preserve 1st in window
  need laidout only bookmarks file
  edits color style: bg alternating isn't highlighting
  tooltip to show full path of bookmarks
  need drag and drop bookmarking
  when you change directories, it should indicate if it corresponds to a bookmark

when resizing viewportwindow and a temp_input window active, make sure it stays on screen?

autosave
  start fresh doc, autosaves which may be saving into confusing location. maybe save in config dir?
  autorecover.. -> when an autosave is newer than the file we are opening
  option to choose how many to save near original file, and how to remove old
	[ ] Backup on save to: __%f~__   ___%f#~___ <-- use '#' to signal increment save
			%f=filename, %b=basename (without extension), %e=extension, # for numbered autosave
	[ ] Autosave.
	  Time between autosaves:___5_minute__  ...ms millisecond s sec seconds second m minute min hr hour h
	  Naming for autosaves: __%f-autosave#____
      Number of different autosaves: ___1___

need option for always write relative links.. now defaults to absolute

file button expansion:
   Collect...          <- gather all refd files into one place. ask to specifically not collect per file
   ----
   Commit (git)        <- ensure file is git tracked.. add if necssary before commit
   					      double check that other files refd by this one are tracked in same repo as well?
                          maintain list of what to collect, what to ignore when committing?
   Commit settings...  <- choose or set up repository, how to handle passwords?? libgit?
   Revert...           <- show log, select old

open from template:
  get template list:
    scan all template dirs: ~/.config/laidout/version/templates, or SHAREDIR/templates
    name -- file path -- basic info about file

really thin objects should still be selectable, need to add a slight grab area outside bounding box
should be able to click within selection box to move all and not click right down on one of them

need to implement image cache clearing on low memory, to substitute for cairo not doing it like imlib did

minimum dp size is not small enough

anInterface::PreRefresh(), for instance to get engraver trace object to render below all selected objects

need to clarify what happens when you open and close documents. open already open pops new window, not sure if it should
  also record ownership of limbos, open and close docs always leaves limbos behind

colorbox color box:
  hsv slide, configurable clicks

color slider popup:
  have a "Done"/"Dismiss" button
  be able to choose which color sets are visible
  make color slider box be able to be a pane
  would be nice to enter number values in any color format
  need palette selection tab
  click without dragging select color
  click and drag shifts, but DOES not set value under mouse
  out click on hex edit is picking color
  optionally show clickable numbers
  clicking anywher in the new/old should swap
  show numbers to click on: 255, 65535, float
  toggle sets of sliders: rgb, cmyk, alpha, cielab, hsl

Gradient:
  resize inner circle, make small past a threshhold makes circle go away
  extending past bounds
  double click to call up color selector

Palettes:
  load palette should have a preview: file dialog preview function
  allow editing palette strips, import those to gradient tools
  custom palettes
  if height < 2*textheight, then hide name info
  wheel between loaded palettes?
  have a none color
  right click for:
    load palette
	select palette
	save palette
	dup palette
	New from a generator (like rainbow)
Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window
    -->delay until proper color implementation in place
gradient resources
  owner: file/user global/system global
  name
  tags
  color strip: stops
    position
    color

Colors:
  color picker that previews text?
  convert to using Color objects instead of all ScreenColor:
	gradient
	color patch gradient
	image patch
	caption
	linestyle
	fillstyle
	path
    DONE images (doesn't use color per se)

in general for windows, need better styling.. too much is hardcoded. problems later with high dpi screens
  for instance revamp interfaces' concept of single pixel lines

make drag and drop selections work

need more mechanism so that popup dialogs stay on top of window they are "children" of

need a global Laidout method of making unique ids
 -> update in Engraver tool, and object indicator overlay

image graphics filters:
  node editor
  graphicsmagick
  gmic
plugin for easy antiprism import for net creation

for purely command line execution, should be able to make a binary totally not X dependent.

Import image list: default previews

externally saved pages, for long documents
  save "page" files? reference from Document?
  and/or save "object" files, with layers in the file, have special DrawableObject flag to save its contents externally

conformal mapping option instead of mesh? see http://benpaulthurstonblog.blogspot.com/2015/12/parameterized-quadratic-conformal.html

ellipseinterface:
  crash on lbdown: dp is null???

command prompt window: command line
  bug: delete at pos 1 deletes space after prompt, then does not allow any input
  option to record/save/load whole session of prompt window
  up/down should traverse history
  control-up/down, break out so you can go anywhere

load document, should load images on display only(done), or create previews in background..

guides:
  snap guides to objects
  snap objects edges to various things

align tool: aligninterface AlignInterface align:
  needs polishing, the lines and indicators get a bit lost
  context menu seems to be the group interface menu
  need way to specify center of rotation per object
  need to make discoverable, not just as key shortcuts
    -> make as standalone tools, now that viewport stores selection?
  endpoints should be oriented triangle, not circles which make it look like path nodes
  explode in normal align
  should be able to scale and rotate a non-line path when not in path mode
  need manual mode.. drag grid marks to position manually... have that option available on others, auto transform to auto
  gap looks ugly.. have indicator highlight path itself, drag that around
  would be VERY handy to be able to recall previous arrangements, so you can partially redo
  final layout options: unoverlap -> possibly snap to path, then spread out on path to not overlap
  extra custom finishing per object?
  reorder on layouts? -> how to handle reorder in gap and unoverlap?
    trace out order path... show with numbers
  drag out path, order of intersection is new object order?
  maybe grid drag control to reorder
  snapping to 0/50/100
  number box while dragging, goes away after a second, or click on it to edit
    if inc/dec arrows, have it inc or dec the decimal place cursor is on
  default presets: inkscape crossover

Spread Editor:
  need to make pagelocation ref count pages, or (need to anyway) check all known views for errant page refs after delete pages
  would be nice if apply and reset should be grayed as relevant
  adjust page preview resolution
  after an insert, have temp wheelable number indicator, update on screen?
  need to be able to move empty spreads
  need to remove hidden pages from pagemarker
  debug select spreads with rectangle -> need real box intersect? do we?
  modify page range gui, click on a page label, where ever it might be... select pages in spread editor
  debug spread limbo threads and page groups
    implement render
	debug drag and drop
  create new document from spread view?
  hide should collapse into a single thing so you can arrange more simply, instead of still having to sift through many

need infrastructure to propagate and save tool settings
Tools should remember their settings
	remember tool settings: double click on tool icon? right click...
	remember tool settings

    figure out which settings need to be remembered, and install as resource.. what happens when diff
     windows are using diff tools? which settings are remembered? have tool styles that are saved, as
     well as the running tool use settings

paperinterface:
  interface for custom paper size
  implement paper favorites:
    be able to nest favorites, item->favorite = "submenu/23", item2->favorite="2", final element is number?
  laidoutrc needs list of custom paper sizes
  papergroup tool needs custom paper input
  debug papergroup tool in spread editor
  paperinterface: in spread editor (done), and able to print it out, don't forget to remove DBG for release!
  options to show order of papers, print all of one size paper first? auto sort order by size? auto wrap image?
  Load, save, add, delete paper groups
  papersizes are not translated. Should they be??
  papergroups:
    work out scheme for resource ownership: they can be owned by:
      1.DONE  Document: if no project, save with document by default
      2.DONE  Project:  save in project file
      3.or Global resource: save in ~/.laidout/version/papergroups
          class FileRef
        papergroup->owner=Document, Project, or FileRef
  paperinterface:
     no doc, define papergroup, convert papergroup to singles pages?
     orient viewport to paper
     snap other papers to various boxes
     double click to edit paper details
     in spread editor (done), and be able to print it out
     more versatile size control per paper
     edit window? should be edit on screen....
        Name:  default single letter
        Paper: Letter, 8.5/11, landscape
        Box: Media [v]   Box: Clip [v]

                          W: 8.5 H: 11
        [delete paper type][new paper type]

should take precautions so that dialogs do not get buried, would need to respond to circulate events

in laxkit, key and mouse state should already be filtered to only contain laxkit modifiers,
reserve names for CommandMask (macs), and a few other custom masks for other weird keyboards

mass image edit, need to remap dirs for old files!!

option to use different go/don't go colors

animated beacons for anchor points to make them visible

curves:
  curvemap needs predefined ramp profiles, remember last, load/save
  curvemap needs brush ramp mode to show symmetric graph
  clip wrap render to graph rect
  brush ramp edit mode: incompatible with wrap? or just have editor move points symmetrically?

lineedit:
  seems to be an occasional redo bug, reinserting in wrong position
  password
  date
  time
  DONE dir

Convert impose-only to be based on feeding it an ExportConfig

clarify how locks, visible, selectable works. base in Laxkit?

object select, 'a' toggle select or not, select all in current selection area (ie page or layer base)

'm' should be able to move whole groups, means must be in object tool?

For objects that appear very small, the drag handles should not be operable.. shift only
For objects that are really skinny, it is not practical to have the handles be a percentage of the skinny
  part.. should have minimum drag areas?

for blend modes, maybe place name conversion in Displayer, in case there are a ton of custom blend modes??

nup:
  fill in box
  bug: not showing highlight on rectangle
  doesn't appear to update random target area when you resize area
  flowed
  unclump
  unoverlap -> define strategy, either shift H, Vert, along v, or shift on axes between objects
  object reorder
  scale panel should allow mpx and control zoom around point

overlays should get first pick of input, BUT if another has a button lock, it shouldn't mouse move update

need a way to tell rect interface to enter move mode with lbdown, as when initialize a child interface

standardize new Impositions: convert to new ResourceManager system. each has:
   interface OR window editor
   class type
   default resources
  possible to define other editors for any imposition type

make "make uninstall" work, and remove coop from installed position

select region by intersect, not by corner inclusion...

When importing from an image list file, should be able to say if and when to auto-make previews
    new option in file, should be easy

mystery data enhancement: import as placeholder objects: if convertible to laidout elements, do not actually
                expose them as such. Keep source in external location, current laidout only rearranges.
                  ---> this is same as import as image, but using laidout objects to render them with, not bitmap images
                  ---> this is useful to have a standard object indicator built from laidout objects, but
                         do not let them be editable
when importing, have MysteryData, which has special attributes "@file-pos" which says
 where in the original file the attribute starts:
 MysteryData
   transform/bounds
   title (shown in screen)
   description
   file format the data is from
   attribute style listing of the object? or straight from file
 in: convert file to attributes, or provide method to tailor to an output format (eps, pdf objs, raster image),
         and provide a preview image or object to stand in for the file..

viewport:
  allow multiple, positionable spread views visible on same viewport

resources:
  should have a way to narrow down what resources are saved when you save a single document.. right now, if you
    have multiple docs open, the resources are mixed
  really should have option to separate or merge resources when multiple documents open, rather than always merge?

how best to integrate Styles, Attributes, and Values??? style types:
 Laidout
 Project
 Document
 Page
 Group
  draw objects: Image, ImagePatch, Paths, Path, LinearGradient, RadialGradient, PatchGradient
 PaperGroup
 PaperType
 Imposition: Singles, DSS, Booklet, Signature, Net:Box, Dod, etc...
 ImageImportFilter
 ImportFilter:svg,ppt,sla,ps,eps,odraw
 ExportFilter
-->Styles are Values that can be cascaded from other Styles
   Values cannot be cascaded
-->C++ classes represent data that can be accessed and modified through:
     onscreen
	 file saved to disk
	 interpreter
   would be advantageous to write a single object def, and output options and documention to
   each of the 3 targets

when closing a document window, decide whether this removes access to it, or just the view to it

from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS especially when dialogs are up
    focus off a dialog, then refocus, must manually set control focus. should store which subwindow
     gets the focus when autofocused.

pointin should check to visual boundary, not bounding box (? maybe just optionally)

customizable object child relationships to parent, rather than simple transform
  incorporate gss!!
  DONE scale x
  scale y
  scale free
  stretch, proxy displays ok, but after install stretch doesn't work
  shear *** seems to be off from point, need shear protection, produces null axes sometimes
  DONE scale
  DONE rotate
  DONE scale+rotate
  DONE move

  add page target anchor
  add parent target anchor
  add object anchor
  margin area not working
  implement rules list click remove
  implement click rule, update display, watch for offset
  anchor names should not have quotes in them, because disk i/o is easier and I'm lazy
  problems when anchors are on a page that is not at origin?
  check for only align objects that are on pages
  margin area anchors not staying when margins change
  transform relative to alignment point of parent (50,50) for center, for instance
  code
  edge magnet
  when trying to move an anchor when you still need to select invariants, flash the invariants
  need edge indicators for more convenient snapping


calculator/scripting
  security restrictions?
  showing defined functions should show the code
  set dump_out_atts should do full atts if any subattribute has full atts, else output "set": "{1,2,3}"
  dump_out_atts should output raw toStr things.. Strings currently return "str" which is output "\"str\""
  debug for
  debug generic with operators, doesn't seem to be working
  debug operator definitions
  debug using and import... maybe remove using, use import Math.* instead
  debug number deref: var a={1,2}.. out of bounds not returning cannot deref.. returning "Ok"
  var a if a already exists should fail
  error reporting up function calls doesn't say pos/line for each expression
  overloading does not handle parameter mapping per overloaded, it is scanning only the first, and using that
  print string plus any non string should stringify the thing and append to string
  curline not getting incremented properly when there is skipping or looping going on
  implement a PaperSizes object that recognizes all the names, or maybe a set somewhere with all names?
  Math.oeuaeou does not produce an error
  allow if statements on single line without curly braces
  inputting lines when open {"( maybe prompt "... " to wait for closure?
  how best to allow created object defs to be referenced as parameter, variable, or set types, it is a mess right now
  destructors
  show overloaded entries


gshell:
	needs massive testing
	type "tool." (for instance), you can highlight choice with mouse, but does not insert into edit, only inserts when nothing had been typed
    *** not getting options for all tool and object!!
    searching seems to be messed up, improper matches when mid stream
	mid stream search is messing up match names
    completion should be worked into the edit.. "object.|" then tab is replacing all text with field name
    when in function, search among parameter names also
    need to search for context names before searching for calculator names
    search within area, not total tree
    text delete to nothing should only show the top areas in search results
    thoroughly test object access
    object.translate((1,0)) -> MapParameters should map the flatvector to p, not to x
    shift up/down for showing completion
    reposition cursor to error
    for parameters, facility for special edit dodads

custom tools:
  scripted
  normal tools, but jump to special settings for those tools..

implement marks
  bleed marks
  color bars from a palette
  spread info: spread type, current date and time, creator, spread number/total number of spreads

turning off overlays should revert icon to current tool

maybe flag whether to export limbo with spreads?

action/shortcut selector overlay

templates Templates:
  save as default, or just save as.
  partial templates, fill in non defined, like use booklet but manually define paper size

ImageImport dialog: (actually, needs a total redesign) import images importimage
  should have preview for alignment options.. grab destination page to show preview
  auto bookmarks, one for examples, or save as template
  Choose/Review tabbed window
  horizontal stack frame between choose/review and preview window
  fancier path selector
  for preview field, show green or something and change tooltip if preview will get generated
  click on file to preview file, preview to preview preview
  generate image previews progress box...
  autogenerate should do special check for ~/.thumbnails to conform to freedesktop spec size and type...
  importimages-> eps --> they are fit into boxes!! they should maybe be inserted into a stream..

external tools:
  figure out a way to standardize verifying that tool exists and is executable
  to image renderers
  to object renderers
  Image editor (gimp, krita)
  plain text editor (gvim, console vim, command, etc)
  associate (object type) <-> (external editor)

  binary_path
  doc_website
  expected_file_ext
  function to verify file
  extra config
  command structure "command %f --stuff {extra1} {extra2} {extra3}"

dynamic objects (generated images, dynamic images, rendered images)
    eps objects to pdf: export as image, plant in PDF as image
    group objects with laidout elements, updateable with script
    image objects using ImageImportFilters
    perhaps add TEX_BIN, LATEX_BIN, and text editor to quickly add stuff like that!!
    external commands:
      website to recommend learn more
      needs what type of file
      needs how many files
      needs what other info
In image properties dialog, have the popup list of potential previews
    preview style needs debugging and testing so as not to fry the freedesktop ones
if you change an eps to a non eps with the insert file, it still thinks it is an eps..
 image objects should auto change between the available image formats:
  bitmap--eps--embedded svg--dynamic
  Dynamic Content:
    displayed as images, or displayed as group of laidout objects
    possibly multiple images or objects in linked list:
      one source creates multipage ps, for instance, each page gets its own object
    controller source object:
      generator command + context
   examples:
    ps/tex/pdf/etc to eps files, import the eps files
    broken down equirect panorama to net
Image import chain:
  1. eps|EPS: Laidout builtin
  2. svg|SVG: inkscape command line export
  3. other external renderer: asymptote, structure synth, sunflow, pov-ray, lilypond, latex, graphviz, gnuplot
  3. * images: graphicsmagick
  4. jpg, png, gif, tiff: Imlib2

move Value and FieldPlace to laxkit? ValueHash would be very useful to ease configs

merge set and ValueHash?

Masking
    pathinterface conversion must be done
    true object tree with all lax data objects subclassed to hold children, and reference parent

debug multi head? seems to crash when showing with projectors plugged in
	screen info should return x,y,w,h, with flag saying it is part of a whole.
	if only one screen, then x,y is 0

pagerangeinterface:
  drag off screen should toggle off
  need overlay close box?
  edit base in place
  should remember old label format strings, to easily select back to them

for range on import/export, should have a range parser that accepts unconnected ranges, ie "2,4, 5-10"

shortcut dialog:
  need mode column
  general window arrangement is really bad
  area heads need to have human titles, _("Image Tool") instead of "ImageInterface"
  mode for shortcut check not quite working, such as ' ' with button to duplicate
  need hierarchy overlap features... it is easy to get lost in different zones
  panning f'd up, close but incorrect bounds checking when drag
  needs to make in window for cursor moving
  numberpadmask?
  char names for wacky xf86 codes.. accept 0x*
  mode based shortcuts have no display capability
  implement search
  need ability to add multiple keys for same action
  svg keyboard out

have option to specify language from command line

reimpose option: center images, but not rescale?

improve split window
  control wheel to expand bevel
  load/save split bevel settings
  debug mouse cursor change when over gap
  simplify pane customization, docking

signature editor  Signature editor Signature Editor signaturei
  number input for everything
  symmetric trim
  be able to enter final size, and adjust trim to match
  should be able to drag and drop stacks
  making new paper size should try to find matching paper name for a given size
  fold replay should start showing FRONT page of stack, not back. THIS IS A BUG
    if start from whichever, should show inverse of folds to normal as necessary
  scale pages preview needs to use margin area, not page area
  needs indicator of number of groups, show 3/10 for current sheet in little box above stack, allow numerical input

  show margin, trim, binding when not totally folded
  for large page counts, need number entry in stacks
  would be nice to indicate when there is a centerfold of any signature
  mixing different page sizes mixes up the PageLayout at boundaries. alignment should be either always centered, or custom
  after you add stack, the added one should be selected
  must implement dragging around instance blocks...
  helper controls to adjust inset to match up final size for sigs of different size
  indicators for different signature instances when viewing page spreads
  need to be able to designate particular sheets with properties (like color),
    as current insert mechanism assumes folds happen before insert
  tab to cycle through handles for numerical input
  mouse over and drag show numbers on canvas
  export pdf or lo doc template
  implement work and turn, work and tumble interface
  should probably be some kind of tooltip to say shift for fold under.
  binding edge must be same orientation for all stacks and inserts
  need a paper size editor stand alone window, entering numbers should convert name to custom
  paper select should give hints as to whether paper size can hold actual final size
  detect non staplable binding edge, show red rather than green
  test impose-only for all imposition types
  be able to specify single sided.. allows bound accordian foldings?
  implement creep

Make extension to be able to use Inkscape live path effects (lpe)!! The run on svg snippets, so should be somewhat
  straightforward to call externally.. BUT have optional tool overlay. Figure out how to reverse implement to also
  run within Inkscape.

printer mark rendering default to a single color? editing of net outline allowed, but
then changes not stored

probably should decide how to handle making windows based on interfaces.. it is a more productive route than window dominant

make a laxkit.pc from laxkit configure

pagemarkerinterface:
  option to lock label size to real space? make export contact sheets a little prettier in some cases

page thumbnail should be rational, ie image should be whole page, not just contents+transform,
	 and thumb transform makes image dims to page coords

in number edit boxes, wheel should allow changing numbers, change on digit mouse is over?
  is it better to wheel at curpos?? probably.. select that digit, must track after changes!!!

global resources:
  current frame/time
  current language, for conditional text

global Laidout settings:
  settings dialog
  color theme
  icons
  tooltips
  per tool default settings
  thin line width (default 1 pixel, but this is bad for high dpi screens)

> laidout blah.laidout...     <-- if starting like this, if blah.laidout does not exist, then abort
> laidout 1.laidout 2.laidout <-- if starting like this, if either exist, then start up, but have
                                    warning message that one document failed to load?
	-> could have a consumable message interface? show a message until the box is clicked on, then it removes itself?

textobjects,limbos,papergroups should maybe be able to be stored per document, not just file, project, or temp
either that, or do away with whole project/document difference, and use only
projects with their own directory, and projects without their own directory
Selected region out to image(s), regions optionally remembered
    rectangle or path?

import/export styledefs should use the extendsdef mechanism!!!

views with multiple spreads

messages to the status line should have priorities? so once mouse over messages are cleared, it would revert
  back to a lower priority message

perhaps split radial and linear gradients to different tools? makes more sense

WhateverImposition, to only have limbos, but extra handling for exporting
all at once imposition... this would allow mapping of scribus layout without fuss. that
  could be a special case of n-up, where you specify n to be infinity, with m number of
  columns, not necessarily aligned, as scribus does.


importimages: remember last settings

Master Pages master pages / template pages:
  have objects be tagged with ref object, so you can create a page with a master page
    that has a "text frame" for instance, but different children per page
  need option to import master pages

some kind of grease pencil?

Saving: multiple documents open, save only the headwindows that refer only to that doc,
OR save no window configs (saved with project), OR save custom configs

need conversions: gradient->color patch
                  image -> imagepatch <- do with image filters rather than specific object type
                  imagepatch -> image
                  colorpatch -> image?
				  engraver -> path
				  path -> engraver
				  text -> path
Convert:
  bool reversible;
  char *from;
  char *to;
  int support; //like how reliable it is to convert, warnings for what is lost
  CanConvert(object, from, to, warnings_ret);
  newobject = Convert(object, to);

file format prettification  --file-format
  dump should differentiate between DrawableObject and pure resource objects... right now, all lumped together
  adapt the scribus xml/att convertor to parse the output of laidout --file-format
  into something meaningful...
  #-------blah--------  <- mark a new section
    thing      #thing's docs
      subthing #subthing's docs
    #docs for following atts indented same as previous atts
    next_att #(one or more) next_att docs

export with limbo, and no doc or papergroup, means use bounding box for limbo?

measure tool.. configure measurements to be:
 displayer units
 object units
 units mapped to either type of units, so can use light years for units that are actually inch physical paper units
have arrows, and write on screen what the size is...

preflighting:
  check for empty groups
  check for broken images
  check for transparency
  check for bad fonts/missing chars
  compatibility should be determined by file type managers, not individual objects
    return if object is currently compatible with some standard,
    like "PS LL3", "EPS 3.0", "SVG 1.2", "PDF 1.3", "PDF 1.4" "HTML/CSS2"
    1==yes, straight out
    2==yes, but needs rasterizing
    this would simplify preflight checking

maybe expand the page label system to have some kind of to-do markup.. this could be combined with preflight verifiers
  or other search activities as work-in-progress annotations

cloning: convert to master: make a clone be the original..
  means swapping the actual master with the clone
  ..if an object is cloned, maybe just have them all be clones, and original becomes a remote "data block"
      to be dumped to file in a defs section? if all refs gone but one, then it takes place of clone?

for clones, it would be easier to have a "defs" group or something, so deleting the original of a ref will
  not cause problems. When deleting objects, must then take care to update parent, so it is immediately known
  if an object is without a home.

tiling cloner: clone tiler  CloneInterface
  new tiling should update viewport color per basecells
  should not assume preview has I transform
  memory hole back, third time!!!
  radial needs wind scale input

  need more distinction between what is a base object, and grabbing a copy of existing object.. too easy to confuse the two!
  copies should be selectable, at least so you can adjust the colors: gave current_base, current_copy
  should have z order controls for base cell stuff
  clipping options when source images overlap in final layout
    maybe be able to modify base cell outline, use that as clip? autocorrect for overlapping?
  snap sources to fit/fill in base cell areas
  implement proper shear/aspect protection for:
    allow shear of p1, p2
    allow non-locked aspect of p1,p2,pm,pg,pmm,pmg,pgg,cm,cmm
  highlighting in selection box should draw name next to the thing on hover
  making new id names needs to make unique
  1m and mg do not seem to work: need a final transform to apply, NOT repeatX/YDir().. those shift without rotate
  bug: not showing orientation arrows correctly when outline cuts through middle of bounding box
  really need undo
  save color hints of base cells with Tiling object
  change color of boundary, and outline preview
  select objects, wrap base cell around it
  implement circular interface
  need rudimentary editor
  need flag for ok for cell to shear, ok for cell to scale x/y independently, and have it apply as it should afterwards
  config:
    default line/fill render style (if any)
	boundary outline style
	base cell outline styles
  should have a render preview to show actual grid coverage
  need finishing tool
  design interface for clone on path
  Hisrchhorn Medallion
  truchet tiling
  penrose/heesch/net clone interface
    penrose p1: pentagons, pentagrams, rhombus, sliced pentagram
    penrose p2: kite and dart
    penrose p3: 2 rhombs
  need progressive search when mouse over box
  autocreate seamless tile image
  autofit source objects/images to the pattern to minimize gaps
  map to inkscape tiling clone on export?

Imposition use cases:
  for sig editor, need paper partitioner, then stack sections
  for same document, have stack of impostions, each with its own page set? would make docs with body pages and
    cover easier, without having to implement full "project"
  booklet contains two threads, read one way, flip book over, read the other way
    remember custom views, to swap rotated display, for instance
  booklet but each paper is trimmed differently, like for tabs
  moebius
  need cutting marks for posterizing for lining up different sheets
  impose only needs access to papergroups
  maybe any spread setup temporarily to another imposition on export?

Net imposition
  create from papergroup: one papergroup used as page spreads, another used as actual paper group?
  net extra scaling non-functional
  NetImposition needs import/export net,
  export svg
  convert to/from laidout elements
  interactive unwrapper and build net interface figure out bleeding and connectivity infrastructure
  figure out more efficient clipping of Imlib images
  finish implementing double sided nets
  saving when net is internal is not proper.. does not distinguish between diff. nets and whole
  import/export cff2?
  export vrml? pdf 1.6?
  save different setups: papertile AND net layout
  load save nets from: 1.net files or 2.OFF files(done)


polyptych:
  can't seem to save new bookmarks or use old ones in polyptych, but it's ok in Laidout

hedron window:
  send imp
  receive imp
  remember net and paper placement
  sometimes paper disappears
  tutorial
  auto generate equirectangular -> flat
  reverse project net onto an equirect for export
  highlight paper when dragging will move it
  need to draw other nets in outline (at least) in paper view
  need to preview sides on hedron
  memory hole in polyptych
  file open, preview hedra
  file open, preview equirects
  need to implement more options for polyhedron connections, to allow mobius strips...
  DONE proper units for papers

implement undo.. ideally use same code for both undo and recordable/assignable actions
  object interface
    need to account for:
	  dragging m changes
	  key flip, or non-dragging changes
	  object deletion
  nodes
  image
  gradients
  paths
  meshes
    color
	image
  engraver
  inside curve editors
  paper interface
  spread editor
  reimpose
  unwrapper
  metadata stuff
  cloner
  during scripting?!
  saveable?

PlainTextWindow plaintextwindow PlainText plain text window:
  need showing line numbers
  clicking around doesn't properly update caret drawing
  need control zoom to change font size
  some day should have syntax highlighting in Laxkit::MultiLineEdit
  indent/unindent selected lines
  toggle expandtab
  plain text edit window specify interpreter to process the text with
  option to show line numbers
  indent/unindent
  move selected lines up/down
  regex searching

pixels units should be set as per document dpi

perhaps laidout configure should call laxkit configure if it thinks laxkit is not configured yet

CharacterInterface characterinterface
  should show unicode number/glyph name if available
  implement recent
  implement suggestions
  alternate glyphs

Spread editor: SpreadEditor spread editor spreadeditor
  should have border drag to move, not middle drag

python plugin:
  need python implementation of Attribute and class structure in/out to help file importers in other python based environments
  need headless, no-x compile option to allow minimal usage as python plugins for Scribus

limbo transform should be obeyed. It can be moved, scaled, etc,
page layers should be simplified, each layer behaves according to its transform, and more controls inserted to handle layer maneuvering

configurable command buttons to automate certain things with minimal window clutter....

dump OUT an image list? Scribus has "review images" feature.. can jump to location, edit print/view, etc

repeater tool on path: could be adapted to help animation tweening

animation:
  animation interface can set laidout->globals.frame, but how best to add callbacks when a Value is modified?


===================Anything below here probably needs discussion before implementing================
---------------------------------- other enhancements ----------------------------------
how to keep track of class hierarchy? impositions are now listed by resource instance, what is
  best way of keeping track of base imposition classes? this is needed for file format description output

for translations, there is a difference between locale translations and language translations!
  not sure if it is worth paying attention to... need to investigate if locale as it affects keyboard input
  is separate from what locale we read in translations from. If it is distinguishable, that is fabulous, in that
  we can maintain the current locale key input, but change the language translation at will...

investigate pdfcreator as method to reduce file size

DumpImages within Arrangements, which are sort of a template of rect regions (2-d guides)
    would also implement the dump into Limbo
	dump into any string of objects, this is really the same thing as laying out a stream, maybe merge this?


historical impositions:
 Name                  Abbr.       Folds     Leaves    Pages
 Folio                  fo, f        1         2         4

 Sextodecimo, Sixteenmo 16mo         4        16        32

directory reorganization?
 windows/ <-- purely ui elements
 core/ <-- implies isolating core functions


a "Place" tool like indesign?? preview images and place by dragging out one by one, as well
 as optionally into Arrangements

food for thought:
  haskell envelope function:  http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/doc/manual.html
