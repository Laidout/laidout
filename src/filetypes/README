\section filterhowto      How to create a new filter

There are import filters (ImportFilter) to import vector images, and
convert to Laidout objects as possible, export filters (ExportFilter) to
export to a any format, and image import filters (ImageImportFilter), to
convert any file to a rasterized image, and treated like any old image.
When running, there will be one instance of each file format and version.
For instance there will be one export filter for  PDF 1.4 and another 
one for PDF 1.3.

Filters can define their own configuration dialogs if they wish, or
they can use the default dialog generated based on the filter's
StyleDef.

Remember that you might have to set the current locale, so that when you
output 1.2, for instance, it does not get output as "1,2". To do that,
simply call setlocale(LC_ALL,"C") before outputting, and (IMPORTANT!!) 
afterwards, call setlocale(LC_ALL,""). Before In() or Out() is called,
the locale will be the normal locale, not the "C" locale. For an example
of how to do this, see filefilter-boilerplate.cc (***todo!!).

Filters should follow the following guidelines.



\section exportfilters    Export Filters

When an export filter is called, it is passed a reference to a Document, PaperGroup,
and a Group object. If the Document and 
Group objects are both given, then the Group is assumed to be a limbo
object, and must be drawn before (that is, under) any Document spreads.

Export filters are called from export_document(), which does some basic
verification on the export configuration, so that filters may assume
that start<=end, that doc or limbo can be NULL, but not both, and that
papergroup is not NULL and does not need to be changed at all.

If no Document is given, then the start, end, and layout type passed
to the filter are to be ignored.

If an ExportFilter can export many pages to the same file, it must have 
FILTER_MULTIPAGE set in its flags. 

If the filter can export each spread or paper
to many files natively, then it must have FILTER_MANY_FILES set. If it cannot export
to many files natively, and if the context passed to export_document() wants it output
to many files, then export_document() will create one file per spread per paper,
and call the export filter accordingly.

Note that when export_document() ensures that the PaperGroup is not NULL,
it may be using a PaperGroup that is different from the default imposition PaperGroup
that is contained in Spread::papergroup. Filters must use the PaperGroup
provided in the context, and not the default one returned in an imposition's spread.



\section importfilters     Import Filters

Import should be performed in such a way as to preserve as much as possible the
data that was in the original file so that an ImportFilter's companion 
ExportFilter can take that preserved original data, and export it back
into that file format properly.

This magical feat is performed via MysteryData objects, and Attribute objects
attached to otherwise normal Laidout elements.

ImportFilter::In() is called from import_document().




\section imageimportfilters Image Import Filters

***TODO! This is still a work in progress.....

Image import filters (ImageImportFilter) convert a random file or text object into a rasterized image.
This means EPS, PS pages, PDF pages, lilypond pages, etc. These are akin to
Scribus's TeX Frames.
