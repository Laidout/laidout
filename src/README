/*! \page dev Developing Laidout

Here are a few notes about the general layout of the Laidout code.


  \section dirs Directories	

<pre>

api           Various functions and classes that can be used in the interpreter
calculator    The guts of the internal interpreter
core          Core Laidout classes relating to Project, Document, and Page.
dataobjects   Data objects used in Laidout, and interfaces that directly operate on them
extras        Extra plugins and such, not to be considered part of core functionality
filetypes     Export and import code
impositions   All things impositions
interfaces    Interfaces not directly tied to particular object types
nodes         Core classes relating to nodes
plugins       C++ based plugins
printing      Code for printing, and postscript export
ui            Various window panes and dialogs

</pre>

In a nutshell, the LaidoutApp (laidout.cc, laidout.h) is what coordinates everything.
Main windows are composed of panes. Some pane types are viewports, which is
where interfaces operate. The basic visual elements that make up Laidout pages
are in dataobjects, as are interfaces directly relating to them.

If you add more source files and thus other object files that must be linked in,
you must modify ./Makefile -> otherobjs to include the new object files, as well
as (the dir)/Makefile -> objs of where you are putting the file in.
