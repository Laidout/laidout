/*! \page dev Developing Laidout

Here are a few notes about the general layout of the Laidout code.


  \section dirs Directories	

<pre>

api           Various functions and classes that can be used in the interpreter
calculator    The guts of the internal interpreter
dataobjects   Data objects used in Laidout
extras        Extra plugins and such, not to be considered part of core functionality
impositions   All things impositions
interfaces    Extra interfaces
filetypes     Export and import code
plugins       C++ plugin mechanism implemented here
printing      Code for printing, and postscript export

</pre>

If you add more source files and thus other object files that must be linked in,
you must modify ./Makefile -> otherobjs to include the new object files, as well
as (the dir)/Makefile -> objs of where you are putting the file in.
