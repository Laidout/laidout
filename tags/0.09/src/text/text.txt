This file is for scribling down rough notes about the requirements for text handling


background
---------
scribus inline graphics:
surrounding text can flow around....
 use the width, but not height. bounding box is used for flow for lines other than current


requirements:
------------
stream/story editor -> probably easily exportable to html

inserting inline graphics:
right click->insert reference->limbo n->obj1
right click->insert object->limbo n->obj1

menu:insert
  character
  text  ->textobj1, ...
  sample text
  object reference -> limbo1->obj1, ...
  object copy (dup an existing object

math mode, basically latex formatting:
-------------------------------------
$blah blah$ set as span
$$blah blah$$ set as div
superscript: 2^3
subscript:  a_3
latex, 4 modes: inline math, eqnarray (equation numbers auto inserted on right), displaymath, equation


inline objects:
------------
objects anchored in text stream, positions:
 stay in stream, use bbox as glyph box, define alignment, 
		v and h baseline (default baseline proportional to surrounding font)
 stay in stream, use bbox as conditional wrap area
 layout object somewhere in stream containing object (flowRegion), or a dynamically specified container (ie page or parent)
    footnotes
	images that float off to one side: v and h gravity
	  if positioning float causes text reflow to have the text anchor on next page, have offset
      flag for whether to keep the float on current page, or force to next page
 tex can automatically collect figures, and put them on a special page, auto numbering of figures


formatting:
---------
initial characters: initial quotes hang out, number of lines long, wrap to box or to glyph/area
	"1st" char, then some number of next chars.. apply to 1st pp of a section??
research: find compromise between tex, css, svg, scribus layout mechanisms
research: what really does latex, context, metapost, metafont add, what requirements to support
tab stops are arbitrary paths
streams lay out in sections/pages
streams composed of any level of parts/chapters/sections/subsections
toc
index
bibliography
  bib id (ie ch1, ch2, article 1, article 2, etc)
notes
  notes id-> figure list
		  -> table list
 		  -> foot notes
hyphenation, soft breaks, hyphens optionally hang past at eol
word spacing
leading, char spacing
glyph sizing
math mode -> lots of extra rules for formatting, access to lots of special symbols
character styles
paragraph styles
tagging, to signal urls, colors, special behavior or cataloging, dynamic content, etc
short words (Mr. Mrs. etc, that must bind to following word)
language switches:
  sometimes one sees things like
   <i18n>
    <en>thing</en>
	<es>cosa</es>
   </i18n>

line breaking:
------------
choose strategy:
  first fit: fast, considers only 1 line at a time
  surrounding fit: sort of fast, define how big a section of text to consider
  total fit: consider the entire stream when figuring breaks
