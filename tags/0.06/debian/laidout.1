.SH NAME
.B Laidout
Version 0.06, for laying out books
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B laidout
.RI [ options ] " files" ...
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBLaidout\fP can be used to lay out pictures and more into cut and folded
books. For instance, from 11x17 inch master sheets, one can cut and fold in
such a way that produces 3 cute little 5.5x5.6 inch booklets.

Anectotal studies among the developers have shown that people who use
Laidout have more friends and their documents get laid out much more quickly 
than with many other programs.

Please be advised that this is a very early version of Laidout. There is a mailing
list and a page describing various bugs and deficiencies at the Laidout website:
http://www.laidout.org. Only you can help stop bugs.

Donations are encouraged! Money and code, that is, not bugs.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics, 
.\" respectively.
.SH OPTIONS
This program follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
.TP
.B \-h, \-\-help
Show summary of options and exit.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program and exit.
.TP
.B \-n, \-\-new \fISPECIFICATION\fI
Create a new document, bypassing the new document dialog. You can specify
a comma separated list of attributes describing the paper size, orientation,
imposition, and number of pages. So for instance a 40 page booklet on folded 
legal sized paper oriented as landscape would be specified with:

.B laidout \-n 'legal,landscape,booklet,40'
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-template \fItemplate_name\fI
Open laidout from this template. If the name does not start with "../", "./",
or "/", then it looks in your $HOME/.laidout/(version)/templates directory.
These templates can be any valid Laidout document file. The file is loaded,
and its file location cleared so that you will be forced to enter a new
location for it when you try to save it.

If you have default_template set to something in your laidoutrc file, such as with
a line like "default_template default" then when you start Laidout with
no arguments, that template will be loaded (in this case templates/default
will be loaded), rather then prompting you through the new document dialog.
