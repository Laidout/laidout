LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.



VERSION 0.095
-------------
       debug version 0.094!
       be able to trace images in engraver tool
       Clean up patch controls
       Clone Pattern Builder
       Custom alignments to parents, not just affine transform to parent
       Implement cairo renderer, make meshes finally render faster, plus general rendering niceness
       graphical shell should also help find and set key shortcuts
       Signature editor: detect non staplable binding edge, show red rather than green
       Tool scripting
       PathInterface subpaths for hole making should work: check exports
       impose-only mode should allow access to all imposition types, not just signatures
       Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window
       color styles, so objects can refer to a named color, just change that named to change all
       Fix object bleeding across pages for signatures and nets
       double click on group should change selection area to group contents?
       Moving selected things in group contents does not update group bounds
       should not be able to select both group and group contents at same time
       Masking, clip paths and/or softmask
       Merge EpsData with normal images
       Externally rendered objects, similar to Scribus render frames
       Examine and improve ease of use of import images dialog, particularly for previewing
       In image properties dialog, have the popup list of potential previews
       Net imposition interactive unwrapper, via optional opengl Polyptych
       Net imposition build net interface
       Tools should remember their settings
       Object and resource tags
       Scribus import should try to apply the Scribus layout correctly, at least for 2 page spreads
       Scribus import should do something meaningful with original Scribus page bleed values
       fix object transform handles for really small objects (handles should still be accessible)
       Collect for out
       PDF in, at least as 1 image per page, for purposes of imposition
       autosave for autorecover
       Optimize pdf export to rescale to target dpi, and compress image data
       Clean up project load/save internals and dialogs
       drag-n-drop text to and from the various text edits (mainly a Laxkit todo)
       drag-n-drop with system, like drag images into viewwindow from an external file browser


VERSION 0.1 
-----------
       First and foremost, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       Implement poor man's multi-contact interface for all appropriate interfaces
       Text for god's sake!! It's been what, 10 years!? 
       undo/redo
       implement command line language tag
       SpreadEditor: be able to eject a page into limbo, for creation threads, connect, then insert as a group
       When importing from an image list file, should be able to say if and when to auto-make previews
       Full internationalization support in window controls for input and output, including left, right. pango?
       Basic infrastructure for most things (except text) should be in place.
       Must be Stable, not merely "Stable"
       Creep management controls
       Construct an adequate command core, so that no X connection necessary for batch processing
       Improve open from template to be able to use names (defined in a file), not just filenames
       perhaps have image open window pane for main split window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
       Change cursor or otherwise indicate what will happen as mouse moves around
       Should have option to print/see or not print/see big, preview, or no images, per image
       When adjusting things with the object tool, must have option to be temporarily a little transparent
       All the pdf 1.4 group combine properties, like most importantly transparency
       Configurable icon panel/menu system, make the button box actually function
       Linear (including curvilinear) guides
       Seriously optimize the whole ColorPatch/ImagePatchData stuff
       Have imagepatch be a transform you can apply to any object
       Allow objects to have any number of various kinds of transforms applied to it
       Some sort of basic scripting infrastructure allowing easy addition of other scripting language plugins. Swig?
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place: add objects, panes, commands, interfaces, resources, command-line-options?
       allow for easy method for runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented, with up to at least 16 bit per channel color
       Resource manager/style edit window
       a real PrintDialog that can configure itself based on printer info
       non-hacky new document box that can retrieve printer capabilities, and adjust accordingly (ie grok ppds)
       all things must define their styledefs
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       make it easy to add/remove/prioritize/replace import/export filters
       support for the svg filters?
       Provide some kind of visual feedback while doing lengthy operations
       Improve and/or make new logo and splash image, and generate icons from a laidout doc
       Somehow combine the ViewWindow and SpreadEditor to optionally allow the sort of 'infinite scroll'
       Be able to interact with patches in a way reminiscent of Inkscape's node sculpting
       Object and page templates, aka master pages
       Pages with curved edges, to allow nets for shapes resulting from intersecting cylinders, for instance
       Optional Midi controller usage
       Able to select and transform nodes from different objects at the same time
       Color channel density control, to not overdo CMYK mix, for instance
       Allow accessing scribus image cache, or try to spin off a non project specific general image cache
       Backwards compatibility with previous Laidout versions, without extra utilities, starting with 0.1
       update french and spanish translations, if possible
       Paper sizes should be translated strings


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Full multi-contact, blob and pressure sensitive touch with tuio,touchlib(?). See www.nuigroup.com/touchlib for diy surfaces
partial Laidout export
Figure out best way to expose laidout functions to other program's scripters (ie inkscape and scribus)
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
The other Postscript/Pdf gradients?: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow pure function gradients, and redefining the functions for the other gradients..
Freehand drawing with tablet support
Maybe bez part of path interface should have segment move like inkscape
Somehow be able to do simulated add-ins/foldouts from within any page of an imposition
use any path as a kind of tab stop
Numbered lists
Mixed left/right text in text streams
Tables
Optional multi-key shortcuts?
hanging punctuation
Automatic table of contents
Bibliography
Footnotes
auto track chapter/section
Automatic, yet overrideable hyphenation
layout inside anything that provides an 'area' and runaround facility.
Finally decide on a real rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? antigrain/freetype/pango? graphite?
GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick plugin or integration: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
  Imlib chokes on really big image files, whereas this would not
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to be able to handle metapost/metafun sort of things
Would be nice to be able to handle lilypond sort of things
Load/save various gimp/inkscape/etc things like gradients, palettes, and paths, perhaps extract from/to xcf
Maybe have ability to break apart and use parts of gimp.xcf/inkscape.svg/scribus.sla, and put them back in?
Stream/Story editor, maybe html export from streameditor?
Internal generic impositioner for ps files that follow the ps doc. structure guidelines->import ps to mysterydata, export those...
for plain postscript, there's bitmask, but no transparency. maybe optionally do simulation with dithered bitmask
Cooperate with photo programs like KPhotoalbum, f-spot
Make nets cooperate with Hugin/Enblend: plugin for panorama projection to/from nets?
Work and turn/work and tumble
openoffice files import
Uniconverter support
Super import place tool, including recursive placement
fore edge printing
fore edge sculpting
Vx support?
Verse support?
Content version control?
dbus?
Net/polyhedron layout 3-d previewer extra (maybe?? software BSP tree? opengl?) pdf 1.6 can embed rotatable 3-d
Perhaps have animation support/mode, 1 page=1 frame or separate time slider and keyframes
Akin to animation mode, have movie/sound objects available to html export, for instance?
a FlexibleImposition for html/streamed output target?
JDF,JTAPI support?
Saveable undo stack(?) (see http://people.csail.mit.edu/sarasu/history/ for inspiration)


VERSION 1.0
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere without causing mass extinction
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Visit Pluto
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
