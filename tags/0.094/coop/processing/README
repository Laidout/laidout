This directory contains a port of the folder of Laidout
to run in Processing (tested in version 2.0b7), and also
a version in a single web page, running Processing.js.

You should be able to run the html version in any 
browser that can handle HTML5's canvas.

Please send feedback, good or bad, to tom@tomlechner.com.
Porting always introduces unforseen cantankerous bugs, so
please let me know about any you find!!


Processing itself is included for convenience.

Laidout folder code here is licensed under the GNU General
