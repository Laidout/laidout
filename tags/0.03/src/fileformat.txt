/*! \page fileformat File Format

This is the file format for Laidout stuff. Everything is hierarchically arranged,
and grouped according to indentation similar to python and Yaml, rather than, for instance, XML tags.

\todo should make a conversion program to do passepartout---laidout---scribus---svg.

**** Please note that this is not correct:

\verbatim
#Laidout 0.1, 0.1
# ^^  first line mandatory, Laidout programVersion, fileFormatVersion

    	    end  454,54
        path
          d "12 3 z 32 23" # accepts svg style listing of path points.
