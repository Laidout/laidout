LAIDOUT TODO

See src/TODO and the doxygen produced todo list in docs/html/todo.html


TODO BEFORE A LAIDOUT 0.1 RELEASE:

- NetDisposition must be in place, it is almost there...
- Paths should function correctly (a laxkit problem), and should be able to print out
- Linear and radial gradients should function correctly, and should be able to print out
- The Laxkit must be brought up to speed: printdialog and menuselector in particular..

(these thing are almost ready!!)
