 *  should hold the bounding box of the page in paper or view coordinates, and
 *  the path of the page itself, which gets used to check for points being inside
 *  the page. index is the index of the page in the relevant Document->pages stack.
 *  
 *  As for other page related metrics, the page spread outline is kept in a
 *  Spread. The thumbnail (if available), margin path, and page number are
 *  all kept by Page.
 *
 *  The page is assumed to be nonlocal, but the outline can be local, and
 *  thus can be delete'd in the PageLocation destructor. If not local, then dec_count() is

//----------------------------- Imposition --------------------------

/*! \class Imposition
 * \brief The abstract base class for imposition styles.
 *
 * The Imposition class is meant to describe a single style of chopping
 * and folding of same sized pieces of paper. The individual papers can
 * be of different colors (***see todos), but must be the same size. Something like a book where
 * the cover would be printed on a piece of paper with a different size then the
 * body papers would not be all done in a single Imposition. That would be a ***??
 * with 2 Imposition classes used (???).
 * 
 * Currently the built in Imposition styles are single pages, singles meant as double sided,
 * such as would be stapled in the corner or along the edge, the slightly more versatile booklet
 * format where the papers are folded at the spine,
 *  \todo the super-duper BasicBookImposition, comprised of multiple sections, each of which have 
 *    one fold down the middle. Section there means basically the same
 *    as "signature". Also, the basic book imposition works together with a
 *    BookCover imposition, which is basically 4 pages, and the spine.
 *  \todo and the WhatupImposition, than allows n-up printing of any other Imposition.
 *
 * \todo needs to be a standard to be duplex aware..
 * \todo ***finishing imping built in impositions
 *
 * The imposition's name is stored in stylename inherited from Style.
 *
 * NOTE that numpages, numspreads, and numpapers SHOULD be consistent with the actual number
 * of pages in a document, but the document can add or remove pages whenever it wants, so
 * care must be taken, especially in Document, to maintain sanity
 * This is ugly!! maybe have imposition point to a doc??
 *
 * \todo *** need to think about printer marks and paper colors. they are very haphazard, and 
 *   built in to the PaperLayout() functions currently. need some standard to allow for
 *   different papers previewing differently to each other, and also to have different printer
 *   marks, but still be meaningful after a paper/pagesize changes.
