note to self: 
MAKING LAIDOUT DEB PACKAGE
----------------------
(if anyone has a better way of doing this, let me know, I'm new at this)

1. ----Get source------
 svn export http://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/(whichever) laidout-(version)
 tar cjv (the dir) > laidout-version.tar.bz2 so dpkg-buildpackage makes a proper diff compared to svn source

 For dev snapshots, the version should be number-date, so like 0.02-20060331

2. ----modify source---
 make sure version number is correct in any source files that refer to it, currently:
   debian/changelog
   debian/laidout.1              :Version ****, for laying out books
   docs/doxygen/laidoutintro.txt :-- Version ***** --\n
   docs/Doxyfile                 :PROJECT_NUMBER         = *****
   Makefile                      :LAIDOUTVERSION=****
   README                        :LAIDOUT Version *****
   src/version.h                 :#define LAIDOUT_VERSION "****"
 make sure the Quick Key References are accurate. There are separate versions
   of it in ./QUICKREF, debian/laidout.1, and src/helpwindow.cc
 make depends  in the src directory
 
 make sure Makefile-toinclude points to correct laxkit headers directory
 make sure Makefile has 'prefix=$(DESTDIR)/usr'. This is important for the 'make install'
   part of dpkg-buildpackage's building of the package

3. ---hide the debugging garbage---
 make hidegarbage 
 (make sure same is done for laxkit, as Laidout currently statically
  links against laxkit, which also uses the same system to hide debugging couts)
 

4. ---build the package---
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot in top laidout directory
