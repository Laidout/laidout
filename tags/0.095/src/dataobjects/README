This directory contains definitions for various drawable objects in Laidout,
and tools that operate specifically on these objects.

New objects must derive from DrawableObject (see drawableobject.cc/h).
If you want the objects to be scriptable, then you must implement some 
functions from Value. See limagedata.cc for an example.

Once implemented, you must add a creator function in datafactory.cc to 
actually be able to use these new objects, and add the object file name to 
the list in Makefile.

If you also have an interface to go along with your new objects, you also must
add creation code for the interface in ../interfaces.cc. If you do not have
a specific interface, the object tool will be used instead.

If you make an interface that does not work on specific objects, then those
interfaces should go in ../interfaces.
