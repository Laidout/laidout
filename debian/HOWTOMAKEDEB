note to self: 
 Most of these notes are to help the developer(s) package Laidout for releases.
 If you just want to make a deb package yourself, skip down to "build the package".


               NEW RELEASES
MAKING LAIDOUT DEB PACKAGE AND SRC TARBALL
----------------------
(if anyone has a better way of doing this, let me know, I'm new at this)


1. Double check that these are current:
  debian/laidout.1
  the laidoutrc description dump out in laidout.cc


2. ----Copy trunk to a new tag------
 svn copy https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/trunk \
          https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(whatever version)
 make sure the Makefile does not try to compile lax


3. ----modify source---
 check out the branch: svn co https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(version)
 make sure any references to the current date are accurate, currently:
   debian/control
   debian/laidout.1
 make sure version number is correct in any source files that refer to it, currently:
   debian/changelog
   debian/laidout.1              :Version ****, for laying out books
   docs/doxygen/laidoutintro.txt :-- Version ***** --\n
   docs/Doxyfile                 :PROJECT_NUMBER         = *****
   docs/Doxyfile-with-laxkit     :PROJECT_NUMBER         = *****
   configure
   README                        :LAIDOUT Version *****
   all the example docs
 make sure the Quick Key References are accurate. There are separate versions
   of it in ./QUICKREF, debian/laidout.1, and src/helpwindow.cc
 touch Makefile-toinclude; make touchdepends;
 
 make sure configure defaults to 'prefix=/usr/local/'. This is what should be in a source tarball
 make sure 'make' does not try to make lax or laxinterfaces unless laxkit has been 
   downloaded into the source tree...
 
 make sure all the examples work, and have the correct version number


4. ---hide the debugging garbage and commit---
 make hidegarbage 
 (make sure same is done for laxkit, as Laidout currently statically
  links against laxkit, which also uses the same system to hide debugging code)
 svn ci -m'Last minute touchups to this tag'


5. Export a copy of the new tag and make a tarball. 
 svn export https://laidout.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laidout/tags/(whichever) laidout-(version)
  If Laxkit is to be included, you should export that to the top laidout dir: 
 svn export https://laxkit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/laxkit/laxkit/trunk laxkit
 Do './configure' in the laxkit directory, and for the laidout configure, make sure it always
   configures to the installed laxkit dir. Configure laidout temporarily to get Makefile-toinclude,
   which lets you do 'make depends'. then 'make clean'.
   -to do this in laidout/src: vi `find . -name makedepend`, then something like :%s/\/home\/..../..\/
 make sure all the makedepend files have RELATIVE references, seems to prefer absolute a lot of the time
 make hidegarbage if you haven't already, in src AND in laxkit
 in laidout top dir: rm src/configured.h Makefile-toinclude config.log
 make icons  (for convenience, in case people don't have inkscape installed)
 cd to dir above laidout, and do:
    tar cjv (the dir) > laidout-version.tar.bz2 
   this should be the distributed tarball, unpack in some other dir and do a test compile.


6. ---build the package---
dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot in top laidout directory
This often will expose otherwise unknown errors, I think because making the deb packages uses lots more
compile flags. You can do "fakeroot debian/rules binary" to not have to recompile everything after fixing.


7. After file release is uploaded, don't forget to:
     - update the help and screenshots sections on the website, and the website in general
     - update the laidout rss feed
     - send announcement to at least the laidout mailing list
