LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.



VERSION 0.091
------------
       Debug enough to not be too embarrassing
(done) Do a poor man's multi-contact touch screen interface with 2 mice and Xinput2: object tool only, so far
       Images should maintain their aspect ratio by default when scaling
       Scribus import must make sure linked text and linked table mystery data behave properly on export
(done) Generic fold and trim imposition
(done) Be able to load imposition instances, a form of resource
(done) Import images as flow/centered within page margins, not within page outline
(done) Import images with alignment per page type into the page margin region
       SpreadEditor: improvements: re-re-fix auto layout, insert blanks, delete pages, etc.
       SpreadEditor: load/ save many spread editor views with doc (including marker placement, other settings)
       SpreadEditor: be able to eject a page into limbo, in addition to swap and slide
(done) SpreadEditor: editor should allow changing working document
(done) SpreadEditor: be able to change marks of many pages at once
       from laxkit: clear up focus handling which currently REALLY SUCKS especially when dialogs or menus are up
       from laxkit: related to focus handling: clean up pop up menus which currently REALLY SUCK


VERSION 0.092
-------------
       At bare minimum, path interface use should not cause a seg fault
       Fix page bleeding for signatures and nets
       Scribus import must support master pages
       SpreadEditor: working with >100 image heavy pages does strange hangs, and starts really slow. Fix!
       PathInterface must be drastically improved, and bez part should have segment move like inkscape
       Gui for modifying Page Labels
       Net imposition interactive unwrapper and build net interface
       need partial Laidout import and export
       When importing from an image list file, should be able to say if and when to auto-make previews
       Units, especially Allow changing units in rulers: metric/standard, also physical/object
       In image properties dialog, have the popup list of potential previews
       Examine and improve ease of use of import images dialog, particularly for previewing
       Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window
       Object and resource tags
       Masking, clip paths and/or softmask
       Externally rendered objects, similar to Scribus render frames
       drag-n-drop text to and from the various text edits (mainly a Laxkit todo)
       drag-n-drop with system, like drag images into viewwindow from an external file browser
       Clean up project load/save internals and dialogs
       Collect for out
       double click on group should change selection area to group contents?
       update french and spanish translations, if possible
       Tools should remember their settings
       DumpImages within Arrangements, sort of a template of positions (2-d guides)
       Clean up patch controls
       Fix multi-object selection move when crossing page boundaries


VERSION 0.1 
-----------
       First and foremost, need copious testing by people who are not me.
       Implement poor man's multi-contact interface for all appropriate interfaces
       undo/redo, with saveable undo stack(?) (see http://people.csail.mit.edu/sarasu/history/ for inspiration)
       Full internationalization support in window controls for input and output, including left, right. pango?
       Basic infrastructure for most things (except text) should be in place.
       Must be Stable, not merely "Stable"
       Construct an adequate command core, so that no X connection necessary for batch processing
       should probably put laidout stuff in its own namespace, just to be polite
       Improve open from template to be able to use names (defined in a file), not just filenames
       perhaps have image open window pane for main split window? drag and drop in images? that would be AWESOME
       Change cursor or otherwise indicate what will happen as mouse moves around
       Should have option to print/see or not print/see big, preview, or no images, per image
       When adjusting things with the object tool, must have option to be temporarily a little transparent
       All the pdf 1.4 group combine properties, like most importantly transparency
       Configurable icon panel/menu system, make the button box actually function
       Linear (including curvilinear) guides
       for laxkit: SplitWindow: tabbed panes
       Seriously optimize the whole ColorPatch/ImagePatchData stuff
       Have imagepatch be a transform you can apply to any object
       Allow objects to have any number of various kinds of transforms applied to it
       Fully configurable shortcuts, with optional multi-key shortcuts
       Some sort of basic scripting infrastructure allowing easy addition of other scripting language plugins
       Plugin infrastructure should be in place: add objects, panes, commands, interfaces, resources, command-line-options?
       allow for easy method for runaround area determination
       Full color management implemented, with up to at least 16 bit per channel color
       a real PrintDialog that can configure itself based on ppds
       Generic style edit window
       non-hacky new document box that can retrieve printer capabilities, and adjust accordingly (ie grok ppds)
       all things must define their styledefs
       Low level tree editor, akin to the xml editor in inkscape
       make it easy to add/remove/prioritize/replace import/export filters
       PDF in?
       support for the svg filters?
       Provide some kind of visual feedback while doing lengthy operations
       Finish implementing booklet/double sided vertical, and BasicBookImposition
       Improve and/or make new logo and splash image, and generate icons from a laidout doc
       have an image in the little pan popups
       Somehow combine the ViewWindow and SpreadEditor to optionally allow the sort of 'infinite scroll'
       Be able to interact with patches in a way reminiscent of Inkscape's node sculpting
       Object and page templates, aka master pages
       Pages with curved edges, to allow nets for shapes resulting from intersecting cylinders, for instance
       Optional Midi controller usage
       Able to select and transform nodes from different objects at the same time
       Color channel density control, to not overdo CMYK mix, for instance
       Align and distribute tool
       Allow accessing scribus image cache, or try to spin off a non project specific general image cache


VERSION 0.2
-----------
Full multi-contact, blob and pressure sensitive touch with tuio,touchlib(?). See www.nuigroup.com/touchlib for diy surfaces
Figure out best way to expose laidout functions to other program's scripters (ie inkscape and scribus)
Bezier color patch freeform, rather than just grid.
The other Postscript/Pdf gradients?: Triangle strip and Triangle Mesh
Possibly allow pure function gradients, and redefining the functions for the other gradients..
Freehand drawing with tablet support
Somehow be able to do simulated add-ins/foldouts from within any page of an imposition
fancy arranging to align along any path, and use any path as a kind of tab stop
Text for god's sake!! This means at least a basic line breaker,
Numbered lists
Mixed left/right text in text streams
Tables
hanging punctuation
Automatic table of contents
Bibliography
Footnotes
auto track chapter/section
Automatic, yet overrideable hyphenation
layout inside anything that provides an 'area' and runaround facility.
Finally decide on a real rendering backend: cairo? antigrain? antigrain/freetype/pango? graphite?
Basically full SVG print support, once svg print stabilizes
GraphicsMagick/ImageMagick plugin or integration: benefits: a gazillion file formats, including EPS, and color profiles
  Imlib chokes on really big image files, whereas this would not
Would be nice to have tex/latex text and equation reader
Would be nice to be able to handle metapost/metafun sort of things
Would be nice to be able to handle lilypond sort of things
Load/save various gimp/inkscape/etc things like gradients, palettes, and paths, perhaps extract from/to xcf
Maybe have ability to break apart and use parts of gimp.xcf/inkscape.svg/scribus.sla, and put them back in?
Stream/Story editor, maybe html export from streameditor?
Internal generic impositioner for ps files that follow the ps doc. structure guidelines->import ps to mysterydata, export those...
for plain postscript, there's bitmask, but no transparency. maybe optionally do simulation with dithered bitmask
Cooperate with photo programs like KPhotoalbum, f-spot
Make nets cooperate with Hugin/Enblend: plugin for panorama projection to/from nets?
Export PLAN files for podofoimpose
openoffice files import
Uniconverter support
fore edge printing
fore edge sculpting
Vx support?
Verse support?
dbus?
Net/polyhedron layout 3-d previewer extra (maybe?? software BSP tree? opengl?) pdf 1.6 can embed rotatable 3-d
Perhaps have animation support/mode, 1 page=1 frame or separate time slider and keyframes
Akin to animation mode, have movie/sound objects available to html export, for instance?
a FlexibleImposition for html/streamed output target?
JDF support?


VERSION 1.0
-----------
End world hunger
Stabilize the biosphere without causing mass extinction
Neutralize all nuclear waste
Visit Pluto
While i'm at it, I'd like a pony.
