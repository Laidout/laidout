LAIDOUT ROADMAP
---------------
Things to do before the next release.
This is a very rough draft of a roadmap, and is by no means the final word.

(done) Animated gif import
(done) Clip paths
(done) Clip path in place editing
(done) Convert backend to using Theme objects for easier adjusting in the future
(done) Fix object bleeding across pages for signatures and nets (issue #12)
(done) Make Imlib2 dependency optional, prepare replacement image loading with GraphicsMagick
(done) Html gallery output with optional template
       Way to export svg embedded into html
       lock down color backend.. it's currently a series of weak hacks based on 8-bit screen rgb

       Debug Text on path tool
(done) make laidout.org twitterable with an image card

       Perspective transform object filter
       Node based image "importer"
       Empty objects that can be parents, or whose contents are defined by nodes

       layers (object tree) palette
       Tools should remember their settings
       Import Images dialog needs total reprogramming
       In image properties dialog, be able to select from various default preview configs
       Undo/Redo

       Moving selected things in group contents does not update group bounds
       should not be able to select both group and group contents at same time
       fix object transform handles for really small objects (handles should still be accessible)
       double click on group should change selection area to group contents like inkscape?

       engraver tool grow point mode
       engraver tool, resolution cut mode
       engraver tool, blockout needs to be more precise
       engraver tool, fully test tool effects when many objects selected
       debug line outline cache, especially for joins
       make PathInterface extrapolate line join work

       Clean up patch controls
       Clean up project load/save internals and dialogs
       Object and resource tags interface

       Finish implementing double sided net impositions
       allow inserting net impositions as foldouts in regular Signature Imposition stacks

       Tool scripting
       Scripted plugin interface

       Soup up the color box so one can recall previous colors, and/or integration with palette window

       debug svg in
       Collect for out
       export preview
       Make sure scribus export works with 1.5, and can handle new clipping features
       Scribus import should try to do something appropriate with page spreads >= 2 pages wide
       Scribus import should do something meaningful with original Scribus page bleed values

       PDF in, at least as 1 image per page, for purposes of imposition
       pdf export, unicode capable
       Optimize pdf export to rescale to target dpi, and compress image data

       drag-n-drop text to and from the various text edits
       drag-n-drop with system, like drag images into viewwindow from an external file browser

       Figure out what on earth is to be done about color font processing (issue #6)
       Invistigate Flatpak creation (issue #11)
       Investigate AppImage creation (issue #10)
